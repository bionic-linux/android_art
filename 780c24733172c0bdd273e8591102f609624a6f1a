      "message": "What if preceding code ends in a nop (e.g. in a delay slot) and no alignment padding is needed after it? This fix would break, right? This doesn\u0027t look like the right fix.\n\nIs art_quick_generic_jni_trampoline the only one affected?\n\nWhy isn\u0027t this an issue on other architectures? Lucky non-zero encodings for padding (looks like nops aren\u0027t zero on x86 and ARM)? Or is something else wrong with MIPS?",
