      "message": "I\u0027m not sure, the function I managed to find returned a simple static field, which can affect inlining. This test ought to have its own fixture instead of using something from libcore, but if it also needs to be in the boot class path it gets tricky, I suppose.\n\nI don\u0027t know much about what this test tries to do, I just tried to keep it the same. +vmarko originally wrote it and should confirm it\u0027s still WAI.",

      "message": "Vladimir, PTAL. I\u0027d like to get changes like these in to be able to proceed with migration to JDK 17. I\u0027m going to keep the bug open as I\u0027d like to try and switch to using a class we have full control of, the tricky thing may be including it in the bootclasspath. For the moment I\u0027d like to have the replacement for Modifier submitted to avoid build failures.",
