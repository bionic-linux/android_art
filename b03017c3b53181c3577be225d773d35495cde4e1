      "message": "All started threads have no JNI peer. The JNI peer is only used when starting thread from Java. It is deleted before calling Thread.run method.\n\nHowever, having a null jpeer doesn\u0027t mean the thread is started. From the debugger POV, it just an indication we are still in the process of starting up a thread.\n\nThis is really a special case for the debugger so I think we could keep such name. I just prefer to avoid any name related to thread state because this could be confusing about its use. I\u0027m thinking about a better naming. I accept suggestions :)",
