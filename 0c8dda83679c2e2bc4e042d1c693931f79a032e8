      "message": "Vladimir, could you please educate me on what irreducible loops are and how they\u0027re related to PC-relative loads of strings, classes and other things? Namely, why we\u0027re currently avoiding some (but not all) PC-relative loads in the presence of such loops? I wonder if some PC-relative loads could be enabled despite irreducible loops.",
