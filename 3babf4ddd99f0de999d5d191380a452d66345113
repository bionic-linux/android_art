      "message": "I wasn\u0027t able to understand why this call to `dex_file.release()` is necessary - but doing a few attempts, namely:\n\n* remove the for loop altogether\n* saving the pointer returned by `release()` and manually deleting it\n* calling `clear()` on the `dex_files` vector\n\nall returned in some test error (specifically for the `936-search-onload` test).
