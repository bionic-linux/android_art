If that can be solved better it\u0027d be nice.",

      "message": "Some of the details of what we are doing is in the bug (b/179092189).\n\nAs part of trying to run all the cc_test /host_supported:true / gtest:true, I look at what fails, and usually can spot cc_test that don\u0027t output a GTest format (which is what the current harness cc_test runner needs to understand the results).\n\nif we are able to make those tests output a GTest format (regardless of if they trully are one) then marking them as gtest:true would be fine.\n\nSince at this point, we are shooting for volume, trying to onboard everything that works directly, we can always revisit some of those a bit more special tests in a second pass.",
