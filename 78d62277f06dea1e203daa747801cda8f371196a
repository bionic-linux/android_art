      "message": "The check is correct. The problem we were having is that we were removing the method from the map and adding it at the end of the vtable. If there is another method later that this method actually does override we miss it. So to fix this we just skip checking for methods that override if there is no way for the supermethod to be overriden.\n\nas this says \"might have been\". \n\nI wouldn\u0027t be opposed to just removing this vlog entierly.",
