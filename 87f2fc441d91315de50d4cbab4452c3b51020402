      "message": "Thanks!\nBut I don\u0027t understand the full story here. Two questions:\n\n1. Are we regularly running this with targetSDK \u003e 34? If so, the new failure makes sense, but I thought we weren\u0027t doing that yet?\n2. I suspect the fixed version will still never trigger GC from ForceGCTracer with older targetAPIs. Is that WAI? If not, I suggest replacing System.gc() with Runtime.getRuntime.gc(), in which case we should get consistent behavior everywhere.",
