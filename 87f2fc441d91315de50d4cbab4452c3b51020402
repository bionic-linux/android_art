I can confirm though that we are triggering GCs now and we weren\u0027t triggering them earlier. I will try to check locally what\u0027s happening here.\n\n\u003e I suspect the fixed version will still never trigger GC from ForceGCTracer with older targetAPIs. Is that WAI?

Though that would change the existing behaviour but I guess the existing behaviour is not expected. So having consistent behaviour sounds better. I will upload a Cl for this. Thanks!",
