      "message": "Removing this also partially fixes go/aog/123772350, though it\u0027s not necessary for that.\n\nAFAICT, if we remove this code, we repeatedly enter RequestConcurrentGC, which after a couple of calls does a CAS that fails. But we now presumably only do this now when we run out of a region, or allocate a large object or the like. It looks to me like this is probably no longer worth worrying about, unlike in 2014 when this was written. Mathieu?",
