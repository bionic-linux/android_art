I\u0027m not sure if following the pattern with `expected_prefixes` pattern is appropriate.  Should I build some separate mechanism to assert against the entire output if our new flag is passed?",

      "message": "Yes, I was thinking the same too. I think the current implementation works but I guess is a bit different from the rest of the tests that are only checking for header names instead of the actual content.\n\nMaybe we can have an split expected_prefixes to expected_headers and expected_content and that would make it clear. Since this is only a test, I am also okay if we do that as a cleanup later.",
