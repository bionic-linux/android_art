      "message": "You mean the println() in the child thread? We could indeed get rid of that without defeating the original purpose of the test. But the problem here would have been much more difficult to debug without it, so I\u0027m a bit hesitant to do that.\n\nAnd I haven\u0027t seen any failures in which it was reordered with the main thread println(). Looking at the PrintStream code, that\u0027s to be expected; the first thing println does is enter the monitor associated with the stream. (And that\u0027s always uncontended.) So I convinced myself that it shouldn\u0027t actually add any plausible failure scenarios. The only problem seems to be that if it was slow to complete, we used to set success too late. I think with this change, we are immune against slow println()  completion.",
