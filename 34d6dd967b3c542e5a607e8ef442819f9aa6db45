      "message": "The visibly-erroneous result happened this time with 4.9 gcc and two specific mips arch variants.  We believe the front-end confusions about the programmer\u0027s intent could possibly give bad results on on any target and any version of gcc or clang.\n\nWe think the 4.9 compiler drift that exposed the problem in 4.9 mips builds, was some seemingly-harmless change to codeopt methods, not a front end change to aliasing analysis.\n\nI tried packaging this flag change in the new style as\n\nART_TARGET_CFLAGS_mips :\u003d -fno-strict_aliasing\n\nbut found that the generic XYZ_mips flag mechanism wasn\u0027t yet implemented here.  I\u0027ll use explicit conditional assigns here, if you wish.\n\nI also tried my hand at modifying runtime/handle.h along the lines suggested by Gilmore in the gcc buzilla record, but I don\u0027t know enough C++ to get it right, or even compilable.",
