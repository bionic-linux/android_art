      "message": "The only slight concern I have with this compared to using the product out dir directly is that it will need updating if linkerconfig starts reading other files, and if it only warns about missing files we might not notice.\n\nOne thing we could do is copy system/etc wholesale to make it somewhat less brittle.\n\nMore importantly, it\u0027d be good to be able to promote the linkerconfig warnings to errors, so we won\u0027t miss them. Either implicitly when it\u0027s compiled for host, or explicitly with an argument. WDYT?",
