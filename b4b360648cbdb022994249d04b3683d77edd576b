And looking at TI specification doesn\u0027t help because it doesn\u0027t explain it [for ART].\n\nI remember I had to do some magic *2 multiplication when implementing titrace and I\u0027m not sure if that still applies here?\n\nLogically the jlocation is the byte-offset for RI and code units offset (bytes*2) for ART? Is that correct? \n\nThe README should say something like  that ^",
