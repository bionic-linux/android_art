Firstly it ought to be obvious for anyone in ART/Libcore teams who owns them, and secondly I\u0027m not sure the ownership of the tests themselves matters in this context (we in Mainline team manage them here anyway, because they\u0027re all ART module tests). I wouldn\u0027t bother with comments either, actually.\n\n`other_cts_libcore_tests_shard_tests` made sense before this, but that was because it classified the tests that went into this shard, not because the test ownership is important in its own right here.",
