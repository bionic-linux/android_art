      "message": "No, it\u0027s not. I\u0027ve added this because the tests rely on if-simplification (swap successors when condition is BooleanNot) to trigger the DCE. This CL was originally based on top of the reverted one which enabled all passes for try/catch so it was running boolean_simplifier then. As soon as Aart\u0027s Dynamic BCE gets in, I\u0027ll remove this. Sorry, should have made this clearer.",
