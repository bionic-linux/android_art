      "message": "Actually those instruction are not sunk for debuggable apps (there is a check graph_-\u003eIsDebuggable()) so my added test fails in non-debuggable mode only.\n\nActually my question is more generic and is about the restrictions on preserving the environment uses for non-debuggable graph which are set by this test (466-get-live-vreg) and the commit (https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/art/+/144250). This can be reformulated as \"why do we keep env_uses for which ShouldBeLiveForEnvironment(...) returns \"false\"?\n\nBTW, my comment might have been missed:\n\"Hi! I\u0027ve been recently investigating whether it\u0027s possible to optimize out some environment uses (the naive (and probably invalid) \"remove-almost-all\" case gives ~3.5% code size reduction). Thus I would really appreciate if you could comment on the following questions.\n\n1. What is the contract between the compiler in non-debuggable mode and native code in terms of which v-register are supposed to be accessible via StackVisitor?\n2. Why do we have such restrictions that in non-debuggable mode we must have the values of the primitive types preserved in the environments? I understand the HDeoptimize case but what about others?\n3. I have also come up with a example (in 466-get-live-vreg) which in my understanding should pass however it fails due to code sinking removing some env-uses. Is my understanding incorrect?\"",
