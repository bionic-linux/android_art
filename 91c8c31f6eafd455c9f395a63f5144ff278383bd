However, looking at diff PS8 PS11, for example, makes it look as if the comment applied to the entire line.\n\nThe style cleanup I suggested was to just get rid of the `\u003carch\u003eContext::` qualification. Besides being unnecessary, that qualification is quite odd, considering that it all resolves to the architecture-independent `Context` anyway.",
