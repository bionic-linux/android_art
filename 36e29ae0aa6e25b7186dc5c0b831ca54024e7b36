As a consumer of the API, I wonder whether we\u0027d do better to handle times with std::chrono. The time ranges would be clearer in the list here and conversions less manual.\n\ne.g. timestamp of report start is timestamp_millis, this is microseconds.\n\nOr maybe use helpers from time_utils.h to define upper and lower bounds here.",
