      "message": "Basically this could lead to one less GC being done in the case when we have GC almost full.\n\nIf you recall we reduced the number of GCs we do at that stage to 2. With this line there, it\u0027s possible that we perform only one GC before giving up. But this would happen only if some other thread was already running a GC when we enter AllocateInternalWithGc().\n\nI\u0027m not sure if that should be considered critical enough to be CP\u0027ed to S.",
