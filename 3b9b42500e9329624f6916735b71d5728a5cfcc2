The DO NOT SUBMITs look pretty good here too (ignore-revs, thumbs up).\n\nI\u0027ve been using something similar locally, but not been ready to push this far: mine has occasional issues with cpplint and a few places where clang-format won\u0027t match the ART C++ style.\n\nIt\u0027d be good to have a bug and some group discussion on this particularly wrt to timing and WIP.",

      "message": "There are still a couple of cases I\u0027m not happy about, but I\u0027m willing to live with them in exchange for automatic formatting.\n\nI\u0027ll create a bug and I\u0027m more than happy to have a conversation, but in the past these have usually fizzled out fairly quickly without any action.  I figured if we landed a non-enforcing format file it\u0027d give people something concrete to discuss instead of painting a non-existent bike shed.\n\nSteps after \"non-enforcing\" would definitely need team consensus and planning :-)",
