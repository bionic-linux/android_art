The DO NOT SUBMITs look pretty good here too (ignore-revs, thumbs up).\n\nI\u0027ve been using something similar locally, but not been ready to push this far: mine has occasional issues with cpplint and a few places where clang-format won\u0027t match the ART C++ style.\n\nIt\u0027d be good to have a bug and some group discussion on this particularly wrt to timing and WIP.",
