      "message": "Can you say a little more about why you increased this? Did you observe a significant difference with this change?\n\nThere\u0027s a bit of a trade-off against robustness here: The larger the number, the more likely it is that we will fail to notice a sequence of very large malloc allocations that should have triggered a GC. On the other hand, we do test regularly on host with 384, so I don\u0027t think we\u0027re very sensitive to this value on large memory devices. Perhaps we want a separate smaller constant for LowMemoryMode?",
