      "message": "An alternative I thought was to always do `codegen_-\u003eCheckGCCardIsValid(temp1, temp2, array);` if `codegen_-\u003eCanCheckGCCard() ` is true. This would make debug builds slower (as it would run even when we just marked the GC card) but it would simplify the logic here.\n\narm32, x86, x86_64 would benefit more from this than arm64/riscv64 (where the logic is simpler)",
