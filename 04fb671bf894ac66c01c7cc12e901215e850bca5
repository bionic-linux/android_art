      "message": "\u003e Can\u0027t the name of a thread be defined at the user level?\n\nYes, you are right about thread name. I think thread name isn\u0027t a good fix. \n\n\u003e Don\u0027t we have something in the runtime that can do this check instead?\n\nI couldn\u0027t find anything else to identify the Shutdown thread. Maybe we could consider adding a \"InternalThreadGroup\" to identify such threads but since it\u0027s a temporary fix it might not be a good idea. Though, I could potentially set the Shutdown thread as a runtime thread and the callbacks won\u0027t be called.  We don\u0027t allow class loading on runtime threads. Do we need this on a Shutdown thread or can I just set it as a Runtime thread?\n\n\u003e Would IsShuttingDown be good enough to avoid sending events?\n\nIsShuttingDown is set much later in the shutdown process. The very first thing we do in ~Runtime is to attach a thread which is where this callback is being called. IsShuttingDown is set after we shutdown JIT and wait for any ongoing GC to complete. I don\u0027t think I can set the shutting_down_ earlier because we disallow many things once that is set including Attaching threads. I could introduce a new variable to indicate that shutdown was initiated and prevent any Thread attach callbacks. I will try this if setting it as a Runtime thread isn\u0027t an option.",

      "message": "Yes, you are right. Shutdown thread is the main thread. \n\nI was actually thinking of a different solution. Maybe once the Shutdown starts, we don\u0027t expect any callbacks other than phase_callbacks_ (for VMDeath) and sigquit_callbacks_ (for dumping when aborting). So maybe we can simply clear the callbacks related to other things like thread callbacks, method callbacks etc., Though I am not quite sure I understand what the standard says. Standard is clear that we don\u0027t need to send any events after VMDeath event. VMDeath event is sent in ~Runtime after attaching the GC thread and waiting for any GC to finish. I will think a bit more about this.",
