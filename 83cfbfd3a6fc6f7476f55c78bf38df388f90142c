      "message": "Hmmm... I don\u0027t know.  So I tried for example `cs_CZ` to see what happens.  It broke the tests because Java printed currency in different format (but not because locale-specific data would be missing from the system).\n\nSo I think it is a feature.  It ensures the tests will pass (print expected output), even if user\u0027s locale isn\u0027t en_US\n\nHaving said that, the build bot is unhappy with something... investigating...",

      "message": "Hmmm... I would rather have separate commands so that it is possible to merge the host and target code paths (for example `run(setupapex_cmdline)` can be just guarded by `if host`.\n\nI imagine that during debugging you might be interested to re-run just the last (failing) command?\n\nOn the other hand, the whole point of this exercise is to make sure I can factor out how the commands are executed, and change the behavior so we can only record the command, and trade-fed is to execute it later.\n\nSo, yes, running this script and then executing the commands separately is the whole point.\n\nDetails to be determined.  For example, the run_cmd could be appending the commands to one uber bash file.",
