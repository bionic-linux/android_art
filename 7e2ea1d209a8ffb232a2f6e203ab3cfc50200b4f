In the context of the test, we\u0027re supposed to be in compilation mode (Runtime::IsCompiler \u003d\u003d true) so the method verifier use imprecise constants only.\n\nWe should have control on that by passing a boolean to the MethodVerifier upon construction so the behavior is the same than during deoptimization at runtime.",
