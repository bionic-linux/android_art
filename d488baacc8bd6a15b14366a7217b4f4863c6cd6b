I noticed it in https://android-build.googleplex.com/builds/pending/P16515144/art-target-arm/latest/view/logs/build_error.log where the find command gets shown as the error, but I think the real error is later instead (see the full build.log).",

      "message": "This got autosubmitted now, but yeah, it\u0027s not clear to me if/how symbols get provided for prebuilt APEXes. Maybe we have a gap there.\n\nThere\u0027s also the question why these particular binaries need to be found in the system/bin directory. Is it due to the /system/bin symlinks for the real binaries? If so, what would we do to make unstripped lookup follow the real paths instead?",
