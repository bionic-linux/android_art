      "message": "Sorry, I always forget that LON is so different from MTV.\n\n\"Building inside\" a project is well-defined. That\u0027s why mm and mma exist. They\u0027re different from a top-level build, as they pick up all modules inside the project. So thinks that are optional and not pulled in on the top-level (like the debug builds for ART) will be built when you \"build inside\" art/.\n\nIt\u0027s standard procedure \"here\" to build inside ART with one mma and then mm. Because before ninja that was significantly faster. *And* it creates all debug builds. So if you want to run a debug build on device, do mm in art/, adb sync and change the system property, and you\u0027re good to go.\n\n(And basically this is why these two phony modules exist: it\u0027s to keep the old process viable.)",
