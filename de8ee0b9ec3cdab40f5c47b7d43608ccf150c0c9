Those copies should have the correct location.\n\n(If we expect some extra class path dex files in addition to those in the boot image, we should still try and use those we can find in the boot image.)",

      "message": "When dex2oat compiles app it always opens oat files from bootclasspath. This code opens additional dex files passed through --runtime-arg -cp --runtime-arg file1.dex:....\nBut opened dex files will have incorrect dex_location if application compiled on the host. My change fix this. But, as Andreas mentioned, we need to track these additional dex files at runtime. I work on this problem.",
