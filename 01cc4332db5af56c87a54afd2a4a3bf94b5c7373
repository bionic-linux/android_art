      "message": "This will still be active on host bionic, which means you\u0027ll still need a whole_static_libs:[\"libasync_safe\"] in libsigchain for linux_bionic. But if it\u0027s only for host it should not affect the prebuilts. Still, please build art-module-sdk-current.zip and check that it doesn\u0027t get any paths with \"bionic\" in it.",

      "message": "As you pointed out in an IM, libasync_safe use is guarded by __ANDROID__ so this isn\u0027t a problem.\n\nHowever, the use of \"linux\" target means libsigchain is both in shared_libs and whole_static_libs on android, which although it appears to work is at least confusing. It should be \"host\" to be mutually exclusive with \"android\".",
