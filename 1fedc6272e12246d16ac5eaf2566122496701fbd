      "message": "So the goal here is to ensure that if we have seen the class, and could thus be running the code, we can definitely also see the corresponding generated_code_ranges_ value? Is that the intent? I don\u0027t quite see how this is guaranteed by the C++ memory model, since the intermediaries execute neither fences nor acquire/release operations, right? But it\u0027s probably quite similar to our existing assumption that a constructor fence guarantees that no other threads can dereference on object pointer and see a null class, so probably it\u0027s OK.\n\nI guess it also guarantees that IsInGeneratedCode can see all writes to anywhere in the list up to the loading of the class. But it doesn\u0027t guarantee visibility of additional entries added later, which I also need for traversal, right?",
