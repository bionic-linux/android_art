And do we want volatile store to use memory barriers or AMOSWAP for 32-bit and 64-bit fields?\n\n(We could use LR for narrow volatile loads and extract the right field but that\u0027s more instructions. For narrow volatile stores I would definitely prefer to use memory barriers as we would otherwise need a CAS.)",
