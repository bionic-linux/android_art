      "message": "It\u0027s fine to fix, but a couple of things for the popcorn gallery. \n\n1. The documentation says:\n\n\"For APEX APIs, this requirement can be relaxed. The ABI exposed must still be C (the header must be contained in an extern \"C\" block), but the header can make use of the following C++ features:\n\nSized-enums which can then also be used as parameters \u0026 return values safely.\"\n\nThis is a reverse APEX API so an easy mistake to make. Why it would be different in the other direction, I don\u0027t know, but will re-work today.\n\n2. There are places in the NDK that have issues, e.g. assuming the size of an int, such as EGL_Boolean. These have been left as-is for whatever reason, but means the NDK is sensitive to tooling too.",
