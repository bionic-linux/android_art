I was wondering whether allowed address modes aren\u0027t uniform enough (e.g., whether register-offset is allowed or not) between instructions in the ISAs the test has to support.\n\n(I.e., why is it not necessary to have a generation function given to Repeat that generates them specifically for the instruction under test?)",
