      "message": "It seems I have missed some significant issues with this test when reviewing the external contribution. \n\nSince this test is using the `Compiler`, it should be in `compiler/`, not in `runtime/`.\n\nHow are we even allowed to `#include` files from `compiler/` here? Did we get something wrong when we started linking `libart-compiler` into `libart`? I thought files in `runtime/` can #include only `compiler/export/` where we have just one file, namely `jit_create.h`.",
