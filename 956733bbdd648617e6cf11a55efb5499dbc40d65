      "message": "It seems I have missed some significant issues with this test when reviewing the external contribution. \n\nSince this test is using the `Compiler`, it should be in `compiler/`, not in `runtime/`.\n\nHow are we even allowed to `#include` files from `compiler/` here? Did we get something wrong when we started linking `libart-compiler` into `libart`? I thought files in `runtime/` can #include only `compiler/export/` where we have just one file, namely `jit_create.h`.",

      "message": "It\u0027s due to [this `export_include_dirs` line](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:art/compiler/Android.bp;l\u003d282;drc\u003d3939bde62a7ede383962b336ba797dbd599c5648) - it makes every library that depends on any of the three libart-compiler variants to get `-Iart/compiler`.\n\nI tried to change it to just `include_dirs` locally, but that caused a lot of include errors in `art/dex2oat`, where it\u0027s presumably fine to include compiler headers. So addressing that would need to introduce a compiler header library for dex2oat (but not runtime) to use.\n\nThat\u0027s out of scope of what I\u0027m working on here, so can we go with this as a temporary fix and then address it separately?",
