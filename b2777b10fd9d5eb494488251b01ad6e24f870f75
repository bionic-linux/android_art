      "message": "Empirically, we don\u0027t always hold the mutator lock here, which contradicts a comment for EnsureFlipFunctionStarted, and caused some CHECK failures in my version, notably as part of call from DexFile_closeDexFile to ClearAllInterpreterCaches. I\u0027m not sure whether it matters here. I\u0027ll fix it in aosp/2652371 by simply not doing this if we don\u0027t hold the lock. That\u0027s not ideal, but requiring callers to hold the mutator lock may also be problematic, though I haven\u0027t pursued that thoroughly.",
