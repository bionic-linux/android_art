      "message": "Empirically, we don\u0027t always hold the mutator lock here, which contradicts a comment for EnsureFlipFunctionStarted, and caused some CHECK failures in my version, notably as part of call from DexFile_closeDexFile to ClearAllInterpreterCaches. I\u0027m not sure whether it matters here. I\u0027ll fix it in aosp/2652371 by simply not doing this if we don\u0027t hold the lock. That\u0027s not ideal, but requiring callers to hold the mutator lock may also be problematic, though I haven\u0027t pursued that thoroughly.",

      "message": "As discussed offline, while this definitely should be avoided probably by calling `EnsureFlipFunctionStarted` only if this thread is runnable, but in practice it can\u0027t cause any issues even in the current scenario.\n\nThe reason is that the gc-thread running `ThreadFlipRoots` (concurrently with this function) will not go ahead and do anything that requires holding mutator lock exclusively, until *all* threads are done running flip function. This is ensured with the help of barrier in the GC code.",
