      "message": "I had considered this, yes, but the only way I managed to make that work locally is to:\n\n* extract the performance checks into their own separate list from `art_clang_tidy_errors`\n* move this new list for performance checks, `art_clang_tidy_errors`, and `art_clang_tidy_disabled` into the top-level `Android.bp` file so they would be accessible in all subpackages (as `build/` and `test/` are sibling folders, so leaving the lists into `build/Android.bp` won\u0027t work)\n* change `tidy_checks` and `tidy_checks_as_errors` in `build/Android.bp` and `test/Android.bp` to reference their specific sets of checks to be performed (i.e., `art_clang_tidy_errors` + `performance_checks` for `build/Android.bp` and `art_clang_tidy_errors` for `test/Android.bp`)\n\nAll of the above is possible (and, in fact, it works) but it\u0027s maybe a bit cumbersome for such a small gain - unless I\u0027m missing an easier way to achieve this?",
