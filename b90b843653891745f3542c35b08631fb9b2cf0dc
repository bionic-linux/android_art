      "message": "These tests would be much shorter if we had some helper functions. This could be `CreateLoadClass(dex::TypeIndex(10))` and below we could have `CreateNewInstance(cls)` and `CreateInstanceFieldSet(new_inst, c12, MemberOffset(10))` if the helpers fill in all the other values. And maybe they should take a block argument and add the instruction to the block as well.",

      "message": "Since the exact order in the block is sometimes important (and it would be a difficult refactor to do automatically) I\u0027d like to keep that explicit (IMO a test should be able to be understood mostly in isolation ideally). I\u0027ll add helpers for creating the instructions though.",
