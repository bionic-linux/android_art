      "message": "Next time, please create the revert in gerrit and then download-edit-upload. It creates a record on the CL you\u0027re reverting and it also makes the code review easier as I can compare the PS1 with the fixed PS\u003cn\u003e. If you don\u0027t, I need to download the different CLs and review the `git diff` in a terminal.",

I\u0027m not sure if the assembler or linker can automatically replace it with the two-instruction sequence, or if we need to explicitly use the TAIL pseudo-instruction.\n\n(Note that the assembler or linker must have previously replaced the BNEZ with BEQZ+JAL to generate the error message, so I\u0027m not really sure about the toolchain capabilities here.)",
