      "message": "We had an earlier discussion of this. See aosp/2198821 . In my view, this is a clang warning bug. Since it\u0027s declared volatile, the assumption should be that there is an external observer that will read the value, so this should be just fine. There should be no warning for a volatile variable that is never read.\nBut that opinion is controversial.\nThe correct workaround for this also seems to be a bit tricky, and controversial.",

I\u0027m looking at ยง 10.1.7.1 #6 from the 2017 standard specifically.\n\nIf the comment said \"from other memory into here,\" I probably wouldn\u0027t have felt the need to comment. I wasn\u0027t able to consider volatile had a side effect (and therefore know to look it up), because I disambiguated \u0027memory\u0027 to mean the memory (in the loose sense) that \u0027volatile_sum\u0027 represents.",
