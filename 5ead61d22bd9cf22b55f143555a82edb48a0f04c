[-Werror,-Wunknown-warning-option]\n\nRight, the current compiler won\u0027t recognize this.\n\nThinking more about this instance last night, reordering the members of the class to support the partition of the callbacks into JNI/non-JNI methods seems simple enough (the class is composed of just callbacks, initialization order should not matter).\n\nI\u0027ll just do the fixup in this CL, rather than two. Stay tuned.",
