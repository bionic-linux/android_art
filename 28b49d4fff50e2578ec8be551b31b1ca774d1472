      "message": "Thanks a lot for pointing this out. I think the state-changes that are outside the `weak-ref access disabled` critical section will need to use `release` order, right? I think soft-references are the only ones in that category. That\u0027s because on them the mutator may call get-referent, which will trigger read-barrier since the reference-type object was gray.\n\nThe other usages, `ClearWhiteReferences` and `EnqueueFinalizerReferences` are within the weak-ref critical section, so it should be fine with `relaxed` order, as mutators can\u0027t proceed until out of the critical section?",
