      "message": "No, the usage part is fine. I meant your message conflates those things.\n\nThe problem is that we seem to be creating a symlink when we don\u0027t need to. The *right* solution is to fix image_space, and remove all the symlinking. Using the symlink was a quick fix for the boot.oat, but should be done the proper way (not just replacing \".art\" with \".oat\"). Apps should already *not* require symlinks - if they do, that\u0027s a bug.\n\nOnce that issue is resolved, I think it would be fine to do as you say (if we decide to do that, I know there\u0027s a comment on using a swap file...)",
