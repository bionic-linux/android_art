      "message": "Hi Rashid, thank you for the contribution!\n\nThis issue has been fixed on the package manager side in the latest Android version (Android 16) by commit https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/cbd2f357c2186c00232e393b986ac3585c6222f5.\n\nYour change will be useful only if an OEM preloads a recent Mainline train that contains it onto an Android 15 (which doesn\u0027t have the commit package manager above), but as of today, major OEMs have already released their Android 15 release, so if I understand it correctly, the number of OEMs who will find this change useful is very limited.\n\nI agree with your analysis and your change, and I appreciate that, but please let us know if there is still a need to merge this change given the package manager commit above.",

      "message": "Hi, thanks for the detailed response.\n\nThe PackageManager commit you pointed out addresses the issue this CL attempted to resolve so there\u0027s no need to merge my CL and I\u0027ll abandon it. I do have a question about the \"app downgrading\" implementation. What seems to me to be downgrading happens only when bg-dexopt takes place and \"inactive\" packages get dexopted with the configured inactive compiler filter. That change, however, seems to also make it so that in the case of an OTA, for example, \"inactive\" packages won\u0027t get dexopted again. Is that the intended behavior? I can see how that makes sense but I\u0027m curious if that is intended or not.",

      "message": "Based on my understanding of the purpose of the app downgrading feature I wonder if we need to expand this to include REASON_BOOT_AFTER_OTA and REASON_PRE_REBOOT_DEXOPT as it seems like if the updates contain new apps currently those will be treated as \"inactive\" and not dexopted as a result of the filtering in the default case below.",
