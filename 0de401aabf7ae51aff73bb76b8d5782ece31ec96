      "message": "Thanks for the CL, this helps a lot.  It appears to solve the issue with the `apex_available` property, but the build system still wants services.core.unboosted to have visibility into the artservice target.  Do you know how to fix that?",

      "message": "I presume that the visibility requirement is caused by the changes in https://r.android.com/1582868.\n\nThat change won\u0027t work as is because you intentionally are prohibited from statically include a java_sdk_library. You could statically include \"apiservice.impl\" instead for the same effect as you had before.\n\nYou can use impl_visibility property on java_sdk_library to control the visibility of the \"apiservice.impl\" separately to the \"apiservice\" itself.\n\nWhy do you think adding services.core.unboosted to the visibility rules is a problem?",
