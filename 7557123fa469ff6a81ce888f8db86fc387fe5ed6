I can\u0027t quite tell where they all flow. I think we should either remove those (prefereable, I think) or document them as inaccurate. Or we should compute them only on demand via instrumentation.\n\nI haven\u0027t traced through the code to see whether the VMDebug stuff sactually still relies on any of this.\n\nBased on past discussions, I\u0027m also not sure that the Android Studio team is OK with this. Even if if few people actually look at it, they may still display the information.",

I agree it\u0027s all spaghetti code which is hard to follow.\n\nMy understanding of the flow is that this info only gets reported when VMDebug.startAllocCounting happens, which forces instrumentation stubs, where we do proper accounting there.\n\nSo I\u0027m willing to assume this is the only use case, and any other use case which we don\u0027t know, take and handle the potential breakage.",
