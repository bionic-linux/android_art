I agree it\u0027s all spaghetti code which is hard to follow.\n\nMy understanding of the flow is that this info only gets reported when VMDebug.startAllocCounting happens, which forces instrumentation stubs, where we do proper accounting there.\n\nSo I\u0027m willing to assume this is the only use case, and any other use case which we don\u0027t know, take and handle the potential breakage.",

      "message": "I\u0027m concerned about leaving a bunch of broken code that we\u0027re hoping is essentially dead. For example, https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/refs/heads/master:art/runtime/gc/space/region_space.cc;l\u003d918 and the RecordThreadLocalAllocations() function itself, looks that way to me.\n\nAnd I suspect there\u0027s significantly more such code. I think all the other GetObjectsAllocated()/GetObjectsAllocatedEver() functions are also broken. Or does some of the instrumentation reenable those?\n\nSome of this stuff is printed by DumpGcPerformanceInfo(), which will now be wrong.\n\nSo I think this CL is fine for testing. I\u0027m encouraged that ART still generally works with just this change. But I think this should either go in under a default-off compile-time flag for now, or with an attempt to clean up all the dead/broken code.\n\nI think Lokesh worked on this at some point and may be able to find more of the (minimally) affected code.",

      "message": "You rightly pointed out that there are locations in region-space and bump-pointer-space where we use the thread-local object count to update stats. And eventually these values get percolated to heap. Luckily there is no decision making based on object count but we report them in different ways as part of GC performance dump.\n\nMost likely nobody is relying on these metrics to be correct. However, it would be better either to entirely get rid of them or make thread-local object counting work in debug builds, if possible, and then have them be reported in `DumpGcPerformanceInfo` when `kIsDebugBuild` is true. I suspect that `GetObjectsAllocated()/GetObjectsAllocatedEver()` would actually result in a FPE if we don\u0027t deal with this.\n\nAlso, it\u0027s not just object allocated, but objects freed too doesn\u0027t really serve any purpose. And once we get rid of objects-allocated it wouldn\u0027t make any sense too.\n\nThe more critical requirement is for `VMDebug.startAllocCounting` which, as Nicolas mentioned, is taken care of by instrumentation and doesn\u0027t rely on thread-local counting.",
