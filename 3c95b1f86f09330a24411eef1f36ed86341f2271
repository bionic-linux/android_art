That way we can avoid the extra member in Thread and a lot of indirections in the VerifierDeps. Repeatedly retrieving the VerifierDeps singleton just to compare it with null for the non-AOT case isn\u0027t exactly free.\n\nWe would need to rewrite the ParallelCompilationManager a bit to provide a worker id to Visit(), so that we can pass the right per-thread VerifierDeps.",
