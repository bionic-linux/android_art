So with libart-compiler merged into libart, instead of mapping 108 regular (4KiB) pages for libart-compiler, the process maps one additional 2MiB page from libart, which contributes significantly to RSS. But given that libart is widely shared among the processes and PSS hasn’t regressed, I would say RSS regression can be ignored.\n\n## Performance regressions\nb/293406139 (9%)\nb/293428920 (4-6%)\nb/293386378 (4-6%)\nb/293386255 (3.5%)\n\n@jdduke@google.com do you think these performance regressions are negligible?",

I think the main thing would be to make sure we\u0027re not regressing anything *functional* as far as ART behavior (i.e., nothing is impacted in terms of ART\u0027s logic/JIT/execution), and to make sure that the lib itself is compiled with the same flags?\n\nDo we use any predefined PGO profiles or anything else like that for this target? I vaguely recall we have something for dex2oat, not sure if this change would be impacted.",

Having you spoken with yikong@ about it recently?\n\nI\u0027ve pinged the bug. I\u0027m not familiar with the internals of such profiling, so the only benefit I can think of is to make libart .bp more straightforward.\n\n\u003eAre there any downsides to this?\n\nNone that I know of (except for more complicated .bp code for libart). We\u0027ve discussed that with Yi some time ago and agreed to use this approach, because it is supposed to combine the profiles in a single library without breaking the existing profile collection workflow.\n\n\nAs shombert@ pointed out in http://b/186902856#comment23, some of the metrics had a significant improvement with merged libart/libart-compiler (see b/293693097 for stats).\n\nGiven that microbenchmark regressions are not that big and the improvements seem to be worth it, I\u0027ll try relanding the CL.\nmast@, rpl@: ready for review",
