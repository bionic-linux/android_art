So with libart-compiler merged into libart, instead of mapping 108 regular (4KiB) pages for libart-compiler, the process maps one additional 2MiB page from libart, which contributes significantly to RSS. But given that libart is widely shared among the processes and PSS hasn’t regressed, I would say RSS regression can be ignored.\n\n## Performance regressions\nb/293406139 (9%)\nb/293428920 (4-6%)\nb/293386378 (4-6%)\nb/293386255 (3.5%)\n\n@jdduke@google.com do you think these performance regressions are negligible?",

      "message": "\u003e  do you think these performance regressions are negligible?\n\nI looked at a couple traces and didn\u0027t see anything obvious. I think the main thing would be to make sure we\u0027re not regressing anything *functional* as far as ART behavior (i.e., nothing is impacted in terms of ART\u0027s logic/JIT/execution), and to make sure that the lib itself is compiled with the same flags?\n\nDo we use any predefined PGO profiles or anything else like that for this target? I vaguely recall we have something for dex2oat, not sure if this change would be impacted.",
