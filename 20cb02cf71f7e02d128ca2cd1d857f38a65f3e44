      "message": "Another approach here could be to keep using this, and just record the time before the exec with the same clock and pass it to `GetStat`. That\u0027d avoid relying on the unclear semantics of `starttime`, and it\u0027d also give a time that doesn\u0027t advance when suspended, which seems better.\n\nBut I don\u0027t know when Android \"suspends\" in the sense clock_gettime(2) talks about. Since you reproduced this locally, how did you produce a suspension?",
