      "message": "The changes in build/flags look fine. How to use the flags needs to be discussed more. The fact that we can\u0027t use flags on host is a blocker. Besides, we should also consider linking flag lib into libart in addition to just libartbase. I suggest to submit this CL without the change to `libartbase/Android.bp`",
