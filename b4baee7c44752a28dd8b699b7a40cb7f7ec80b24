      "message": "This file is used by `oatdump`, `imgdiag` and the like, so not linked inside the `libart.so`. The vtable for `PermissiveClassLinker` needs to have some entries for these transaction-related functions and if we wanted to reference those in the `ClassLinker`, they would have to be EXPORTed. I\u0027d prefer not to EXPORT them and we can do that by providing `override`s that can be referenced in the vtable in those tools.\n\n(Note: This makes `libart.so` smaller but `oatdump`, `imgdiag`, etc. bigger.)",
