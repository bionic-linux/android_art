So the changes here don\u0027t actually do much I believe, but I prefer to keep it synced with the one in system/libartpalette.\n\nThat said, I\u0027m inclined to get rid of it altogether, because I don\u0027t think we really need the symbol restrictions here, and it\u0027d avoid NDK-API reviews, having to keep stuff in sync etc. If there\u0027s a reason to keep it that I\u0027ve missed please let me know.",
