      "message": "I ran the tests twice more. Dividing zygote min_free by 10 doesn\u0027t show the system_server regression. Trying again with a division by 8 shows a significantly smaller regression; none of this seems really reproducible.\n\nI\u0027m leaning towards submitting this with a divisor of 10 if we can confirm that it solves the original problem, as I expect. But the main argument here is that enforcing a large heap size for zygotes seems a priori wrong, and if we can\u0027t demonstrate a consistent regression for the a priori correct version, we should probably go with that. But I\u0027m also OK with abandoning this effort. I don\u0027t plan to invest significantly more time. Opinions?",
