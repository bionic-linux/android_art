      "message": "@jiakaiz@google.com FYI, curious for your thoughts. Not saying we should land this, as it\u0027s a bit of a hack, but for initial device setup (after logging into Play Store) this reduced the # of binder calls to fetch artd by ~100x (from ~700 to ~7). For one-off app installs and updates, it\u0027s just a ~10x reduction (those cases aren\u0027t quite as critical, but if we can reduce the costs during device setup and/or after updates, that seems worthwhile).\n\nWith local caching within a given method, we might be able to get some reasonable wins as well, without this hack. I haven\u0027t checked.",
