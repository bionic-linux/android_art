# TODO (STOPSHIP until done)

1. Parse apex-info-list.xml into an apex_info (to make version and location available).
2. Add a log file that tracks status of recent compilation.
3. Implement back off on trying compilation when previous attempt(s) failed.
4. Free space calculation and only attempting compilation if sufficient space.
5. Decide and implement testing.
