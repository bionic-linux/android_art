In any case, this at least gets the script working for the 3 targets I tested (aosp + cf_x86_64, master + Pixel, master + Go). Maybe there\u0027s a more current version of doing the same thing (quick and dirty compilation on the host for simple code snippets).",

      "message": "Roland, do you know if these scripts are still being used by any chance? Are they used in any tests? I did a Code Search and only found that `compile-jar.py` is used by `compile-jar.sh`, which is used by `compile-classes.sh`, which is used by nobody. If this is dead code, I think the best way forward is to get rid of it instead of keeping it updated.",
