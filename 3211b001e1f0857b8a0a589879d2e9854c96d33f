However the reality is that it doesn\u0027t work well enough for that, and hence it\u0027s intentionally left to user, broken though that undeniably is.\n\nSo given that there in fact is a \"user journey\" for `m installclean`, my impression of it is that it may be necessary after `repo sync`, not otherwise. Adding it here means running it much more often in local use. Iow, it\u0027s the wrong level, and it introduces an inconsistency - users still have plenty of ways of getting bad builds and hence need to be aware of installclean, but now they also have to deal with some cases where it\u0027s often run unnecessarily and how to deal with that too.\n\nIn short, `m installclean` is a build system problem - this is not the place to try to fix it.\n\nTurning it off with a flag isn\u0027t ideal - it\u0027s easy to forget when running manually.

      "message": "But it is cuttlefish feature that is breaking you, right?\n\nIf I understand it correctly, you want to start cuttlefish, update code, run local tests, but then you still want to be able to start cuttlefish again explicitly without the code modifications?\n\nWhat is the use case?  Whenever I flash/update device it is because I want to apply changes.  It seems that you explicitly want to start flash/start device, then compile, but ensure that the compilation does not affect the flash/start, right?\n\nI still don\u0027t understand what in your workflow is borken... you keep saying the change is bad because installclean is slow... but I don\u0027t find it slow...

I don\u0027t expect the cuttlefish images to disappear just because I\u0027m rebuilding the chroot tests.\n\nThat is a sign that installclean has the wrong scope here, which falls back to the more abstract argument that this script is too low level. It\u0027s probably just a matter of time before we\u0027ll discover similar problems in other scenarios too.\n\nIn any case, I\u0027d like to move on now.

I never flash/create device with my own image, without building the image right before (usually as part of the same bash command).  \"Can not flash, because you didn\u0027t build fresh image\" is a feature for me, not an annoyance.\n\nThe existence of installclean is kind of admitting deficiency of the build system, so either way it is a hack.\n\nThe script is \"buildbot-build\".  As per name it is supposed to be used on buildbot.  So using it locally is the wrong scope whichever way we set it up.  \n\nI would be curious whether with this CL you keep having issue, or whether is just theoretical worry.\n\nAnyway, let\u0027s move the debate to monday morning.",
