      "message": "Yeah, I could change that if we really wanted to.\n\nThat being said, there\u0027s a rule in google3 about using \"lower case with underscores\" for cheap (functions). If we extend that to cheap types as well it would be ok.\n\nI don\u0027t think they had zero-cost abstractions in mind with their current rules, since most classes have more than one field in them.\n\nPersonally the associations I automaticaly get, CamelCase \u003d expensive (think Java classes), lower_case \u003d cheap (think C or java primitives) and I don\u0027t see why it should be any different because something is a function or a class, it just seems like it should be uniform.",
