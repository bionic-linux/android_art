Changing to \u0027--boot boot.art\u0027 option should work.\n\nDo you plan to land this CL in ART soon?\n\nJust FYI, I plan to spend more effort on investigating stage2 of VIXL simulator in Q3\u002720: how to properly support stackwalk so that more test cases can pass.",

      "message": "Hi Xueliang!\n\nYes, I hope we can merge it (otherwise it will keep getting out of date as we add new changes) and begin testing/reviewing SVE patches on top of it. Perhaps I should wait a few weeks for Nicolas to return from vacations, but there are build/test issues with this PS, so it will take some time anyway. Also, as I understand, the VIXL update in ${AOSP}/external/vixl has not been merged yet, and it is also needed for the SVE patches.\n\nCurrently there are a few gtests failing:\n- test-art-host-gtest-art_compiler_tests64, this is due to unstarted runtime\n- test-art-host-gtest-art_runtime_tests{32,64} (subtest EntrypointsOrderTest.ThreadOffsets), failing the following check:\n  __builtin_offsetof(Thread, tlsPtr_ . simulator) - __builtin_offsetof(Thread, tlsPtr_ . async_exception) \u003d\u003d (sizeof(void*))",
