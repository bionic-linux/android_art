And to check SwitchReceive, you want that. Maybe just clone this test and have a second version that checks receive order?",

      "message": "That\u0027s a good question. As implemented, the messages will mostly come in order. The exception is the timeout, which can come at any time (for example, if we get descheduled for a second or two sometime after line 109 and before here, the TimeoutExpiredMessage will be received first).\n\nFor the use cases I envisioned, the order is not particularly important. I had imagined standalone events that can usually be processed in any order. But, I could imagine someone relying on in-order delivery. I went ahead and added an extra test to make sure messages are received in order at the end of this file.",
