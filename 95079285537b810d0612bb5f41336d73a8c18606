      "message": "Hi folks, this is Harry from the CrystalBall team. Our system process memory test found that this change causes a ~4.5MB regression on pinner total size (please see go/pinner-guide) for more details. Could you proceed with caution on this change? Thank you!",

This CL could be submitted without causing the regression.\n\nWe could just rebase this CL away from \"Add compiler support for @NeverInline\", remove the topic and submit on its own.",
