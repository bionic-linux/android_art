It should be ok to leave out the DCHECK, though; removing the suspend checks is an optimization, and not necessary for correctness.",

Thank you for catching this.\n\nThis means I can\u0027t move this to prepare_for_register_allocation, though, since we\u0027ll have the same issue. It would be nice if marking a method as a leaf were not tied up with liveness analysis, but creating a new pass just for that is not cheap. Thoughts?",
