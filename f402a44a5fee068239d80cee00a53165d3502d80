RSS as a metric doesn\u0027t go down immediately, but in reality you are giving back those pages to the kernel.\n\nIf we can defend using implicit suspend checks as a feature on its own, then we should also be able to defend the transient increase in RSS metric.",

In cases of multiple suspensions in quick succession, MADV_FREE offers a smarter way of dealing with it, as compared to MADV_DONTNEED.
