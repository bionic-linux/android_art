      "message": "Is there anything in the wrapper that stands out? \n\nstrace on the machine exhibiting the crash shows the failure in memfd_create().\n\nThe hack for i386/x86_64 is horrible, but that\u0027s an artifact of the prebuilt glibc.\n\nWe don\u0027t see this crash on later kernels. Perhaps there was shuffling of syscall numbers that\u0027s happened in the interim, I agree it seems odd so a further check is in order there.",
