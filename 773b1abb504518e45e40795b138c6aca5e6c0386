      "message": "I was looking through some optimizing code and trying to understand when the right time to place braces is so I can document the correct style usage. \n\nI am guessing if there\u0027s \u003d\u003d or !\u003d AND ((more than 1 operand to \u0026\u0026 or ||) or it\u0027s used by an assignment \u003d operator  ) , it\u0027s good?\n\n  x \u003d (a \u003d\u003d b)\n  x \u003d (a !\u003d b)\n  (a \u003d\u003d b) || (c \u003d\u003d d)\n  (a \u003d\u003d b) \u0026\u0026 (c \u003d\u003d d)\n\nAre there any other examples I missed?\n\n(I\u0027m also not sure I understand the rationale, it\u0027s quite common knowledge \u003d\u003d/!\u003d operator precedence is fairly low, and \u003d is even lower. Perhaps there are much better examples than the ones I have here?)",
