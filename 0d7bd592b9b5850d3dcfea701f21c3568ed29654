      "message": "I don\u0027t fully understand the problem. I think it depends on the test situation:\n\n1. Either there\u0027s some version skew between the APEX and the platform image it\u0027s pushed to, i.e. they don\u0027t come from the same build. Then setting `updatable: false` is the right thing to do.\n\n2. Or else the symlink optimisation created a broken symlink to a libbacktrace.so that doesn\u0027t actually exist. Iow it would have worked fine to do symlinks if they were done correctly, so the symlink optimisation is simply broken and should be fixed.\n\nIf it\u0027s #1, then that brings along its own problem as you can see in all the build failures - it adds a whole lot of garbage to allowed-deps.txt, which I think was the reason it didn\u0027t have `updatable` set earlier.\n\n[Insert Anton muttering about `updatable` being an altogether broken setting controlling too much here.] I\u0027ve got more to say about the #1 situation, but let\u0027s first confirm if that is indeed the case.",
