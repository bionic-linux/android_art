      "message": "I don\u0027t fully understand the problem. I think it depends on the test situation:\n\n1. Either there\u0027s some version skew between the APEX and the platform image it\u0027s pushed to, i.e. they don\u0027t come from the same build. Then setting `updatable: false` is the right thing to do.\n\n2. Or else the symlink optimisation created a broken symlink to a libbacktrace.so that doesn\u0027t actually exist. Iow it would have worked fine to do symlinks if they were done correctly, so the symlink optimisation is simply broken and should be fixed.\n\nIf it\u0027s #1, then that brings along its own problem as you can see in all the build failures - it adds a whole lot of garbage to allowed-deps.txt, which I think was the reason it didn\u0027t have `updatable` set earlier.\n\n[Insert Anton muttering about `updatable` being an altogether broken setting controlling too much here.] I\u0027ve got more to say about the #1 situation, but let\u0027s first confirm if that is indeed the case.",

      "message": "I think there are two problems here:\n\n1. The Testing ART APEX should not use the symlink optimization, as I believe this optimization should only be used for APEXes bundled with an Android platform product ;\n2. The symlink optimization should not create dangling symlinks – I\u0027ve filed another bug for this (b/233357459), as I think this should be handled separately.\n\nThis CL is about addressing the first problem only. Ideally, I think all test APEXes should never use the symlink optimization, as they are never meant to be bundled with a product. I was thinking about implementing this change in Soong, but then I thought that other module authors may have a different opinion on this, so I went for a more local solution. However, as this CL\u0027s presubmit failures are showing, using `updatable: true` does not work out-of-the-box, so might not be the best solution here.\n\nThere was also the option to add (yet another) toggle to control this behavior – during my investigation, I discovered that Jooyung implemented exactly this idea (https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/build/soong/+/1708173) to solve a related issue (b/188195485), but finally opted for another approach and abandoned that change.\n\nI have another solution (see https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/art/+/2101705), which is not as \"clean\" – this is probably acceptable, given that we intend to get rid of the Testing ART APEX eventually – and which has the benefit of still being local.",
