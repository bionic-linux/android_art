      "message": "David, is this feasible? We need some path forward for the VIXL patches, but considering the amount of work you did on ART tests and the testing image, it may be easier to re-add core.art manually or to rework VIXL patches to use boot.art.",

Maybe this is just temporary CL to support the work in progress with no intention of submitting it?  (in which case we sometimes tag it with [WIP] [TEMP] or something like that in the message)",

      "message": "This patch has been waiting for review for very long, and the context was provided on the weekly ARM sync meeting (sorry for not communicating it to you properly and on time). The VIXL patches (there is a whole stack of them) in their current shape need core.art for testing (they have been written before your changes, and since we meddled with review they got out of date). We definitely want to merge VIXL changes, including test, but I hope it won\u0027t be much effort to make them use boot.art.\n\nI\u0027m trying the boot.art path locally, just wanted to confirm with you that rolling back to core.art is not something you consider feasible.",
