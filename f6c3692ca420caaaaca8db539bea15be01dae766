      "message": "\u003e Could you verify that dropping a prebuilt without this into an older release does not break.\n\nGood point, but I don\u0027t see a way to do that with a reasonable effort. It entails creating a prebuilt drop [like this](http://pa/c/2680985/1), which apparently is done through [these tools](http://google3/wireless/android/gantry/build_workers/README.md), which seem to require Borg ACLs to run a Pod server. +alexcheung, do you have any ideas on how I can test prebuilts produced with this CL?\n\n\u003e FTR - you should not be dropping prebuilts from mainline release into main.\n\nWe will need to continue dropping (and using) prebuilts for (at least) host-exports due to the implementation dependency on dex2oat (but it\u0027s not me personally that will do them, if that was what you meant with \"you\").",
