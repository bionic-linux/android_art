      "message": "I wanted to initially differentiate ART gtests (which depend on ART\u0027s internal libraries and binaries) from \"other gtests\" (which depend on other, \"non-ART\" libraries); another reason was to segregate presubmits tests (i.e. only run `libnativeloader_test` for changes happening under directory `libnativeloader`).\n\nHowever, I had second thoughts about this since yesterday, and I went with the approach of simplifying and unifying presubmits (see PS2).",
