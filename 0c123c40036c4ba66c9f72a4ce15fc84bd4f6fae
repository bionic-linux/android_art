      "message": "Hi Richard, thanks for reducing the attention set and sorry for confusion.\n\nI noticed that there were some unresolved comments on https://r.android.com/1951944 by Vladimir. Since this change is a continuation of that one, can you make sure all those questions are addressed here? After that you can mark them as resolved or obsolete on the old change and abandon it for clarity. Also I think Vladimir should be in review for this CL as he already was reviewing the old one, so adding him back.",

Perhaps you are able to abandon it from your side?",
