      "message": "If you want to add this for experimenting on more test machines, that\u0027s okay, but please a bug pointer here to remove it.\n\nIf this helps with the issues under investigation, it doesn\u0027t seem likely that this is the right fix, but possibly introduces a side effect that\u0027ll help, ie flushing the data cache should not be necessary in userland unless an agent on the memory bus is non-coherent, ie the agent can generate memory traffic bypassing the CPU memory controller. This doesn\u0027t look like a spot to drain the write pipeline either.\n\nFlushDataCache() is a wrapper for __builtin__clear_cache() which is intended to flush the instruction cache which may not be coherent:\n\nhttps://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html#index-_005f_005fbuiltin_005f_005f_005fclear_005fcache",
