      "message": "From my reading of the test it seems as though it needs to use the implementation classes jar for core-libart/core-oj so that it can access the CLASS_MODIFIERS private field. Running this against the stubs would probably produce a different result.\n\nSo, we may not be able to switch these tests to use the stubs for libcore classes. That is fine though as these tests should only be being run when building from source so they should always have access to the implementation classes.",
