Does it mean that libdexfile_support, libdexfile_external and all its dependencies are compiled for the host (read x86) arch and end up somewhere in /system/lib? And that is besides the ordinary libs in /system/apex/com.android.art/lib?\n\nIf so, there could be a potential for ODR violations between the two sets of libs?",

      "message": "Thanks for the clarifications. It still means that all these libraries end up in /system/lib, in addition to their normal instances in /apex/com.android.art?\n\nI assume APEX updatability still isn\u0027t a factor for native_bridge use cases. Even so, if the above is correct then it\u0027s a setup I doubt we\u0027d be able to support. One reason is the different linker namespace configuration, another is the risk of ODR issues.\n\nWould it be possible to bridge the native ABI from libdexfile_external.so to the guest and use native_bridge_supported on libdexfile_support only? It\u0027s a C interface that is fairly small: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:art/libdexfile/external/include/art_api/dex_file_external.h\n\nI might also mention that it\u0027s easy to create a dummy libdexfile_support that does nothing and depends on nothing (-DNO_DEXFILE_SUPPORT), as a stop-gap fix to decouple this from the rest.",

      "message": "They end up in the /system/lib/arm and /system/lib/arm64 (like all native_bridge libraries), never in /system/lib\n\nAPEX is not a problem because currently all devices where native_bridge is used are updated regularly (actually none of them are bare-metal devices).\n\nThere are no risk of ODR vilation not just because they go into a different directory, but mainly because they are for a different CPU arch: arm vs x86.\n\nBionic linker would never accept library of wrong arch, it would continue to look for a different one of suitable arch.\n\nAs for bridging native library to guest - yes, this is possible and we are doing that with many libraries (like libEGL), but currently this involves building two libraries: both original one (for arm architecture) and so-called \"stub\" library used to cross the bridge.\n\nIt\u0027s because of http://b/145028007 - we are working on it... but it takes longer than we hoped.\n\nI think dummy library would work just fine for our use-case, too: we only need libdexfile_support because libbacktrace depends on it - and I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s not actually used when everything works correctly.",
