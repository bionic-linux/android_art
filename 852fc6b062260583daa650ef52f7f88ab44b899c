(Or strictly speaking in libart-compiler-defaults, but then we\u0027d get it in the release APEX too.)\n\nIf so, I don\u0027t think you necessarily have to fix it now, because I don\u0027t know if the APEX dependency recursion works for it or not, but please add a TODO(b/124476339) for them in Android.bp like in the other cases that should be cleaned up similarly (the TODO comments talk about using \"required\" instead of \"runtime_libs\", which is dated, but it\u0027s still the same issue).",
