We think we should avoid doing this here, and we have a suggestion: how about adding a new node in your case, eg HLoadConstantFromConstantPool and change all users of the original constant to that that node instead?\n\nYou would end up with something like:\ni0 \u003d HComputeBaseMethodAddress();\ni1 \u003d HLoadConstantFromConstantPool(i1)\ni2 \u003d HAdd(i42, i1)\n\nWDYT?",
