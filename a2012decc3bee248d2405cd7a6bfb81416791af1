      "message": "I +2\u0027ed on this CL, but now I wonder we need so many exception rules for Java. I can\u0027t find the source of them in go/android-style except for `ColumnLimit: 100`, `ContinuationIndentWidth: 8`, `IndentWidth: 4`, and `JavaImportGroups: ...`.\n\nframeworks/base/.clang-format may not be a good reference. I doubt people are actually using it. Rules like `AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: Inline` don\u0027t seem to match the existing code in framework/base.
