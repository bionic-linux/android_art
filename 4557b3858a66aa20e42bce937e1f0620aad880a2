It doesn\u0027t guarantee that actions performed before the barrier by any thread are visible after the barrier. This is a property the reader would expect from anything called a \"barrier\". We can either add this to b/31023171 for investigation, or decide this is not performance critical, and just change it to SequentiallyConsistent.",
