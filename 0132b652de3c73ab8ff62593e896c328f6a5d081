I can\u0027t find that either art_gtest_user_module_names or art_gtest_module_names get mutated anywhere.\n\nIf you only want separate variables for different purposes then I suggest converting the lists to tuples, which are immutable. I think they work pretty much the same for iteration etc.",

      "message": "Here\u0027s another hardcoded figure. Iiuc the problem is that this script doesn\u0027t know how many gtests there actually are - it assumes art_gtest_module_names lists them all and hence it\u0027ll always be 100%.\n\nThat means this message may be misleading, doesn\u0027t it? When I read \"19 ART gtests (100%)\" I assume it\u0027s out of all gtests in ART. However I don\u0027t think we should device a way to plumb in the real total number of gtests here, but I think it\u0027d be better if the message didn\u0027t show percentages at all in this case. This applies to the other percentage you\u0027re changing above too.",
