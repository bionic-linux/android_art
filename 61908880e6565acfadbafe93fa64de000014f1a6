      "message": "It seems to me that this should be much more careful about assumed rounding behavior. I think most MultiplyAccumulate instructions will not be usable by autovectorized code, due to the absence of intermediate rounding of the multiply results. If x*y is approximately -a, so that the leading bits cancel, this can make a large difference in the result. The Java spec is clear that the x*y needs to be rounded.\n\nThis part is clearly a preexisting issue.",
