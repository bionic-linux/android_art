      "message": "This still sounds very questionable. A big part of the problem with racing reads like this is that if this gets inlined somewhere, the compiler may decide to move the test out of a loop, effectively removing the checks.\n\nThe usual solution is to make the global flag atomic\u003cbool\u003e and consistently use memory_order_relaxed accesses. That should generate roughly the same code, and avoids misleading the compiler into thinking the flag can\u0027t change asynchronously.",
