      "message": "This pattern is error-prone. You just want a `File` that does not actually own the file descriptor. Maybe we should have a subclass that calls `Release()` in the destructor before destroying the base class subobject. (It can also deal with passing the `/*check_usage\u003d*/ false` to the base class constructor.)",

      "message": "Yes, but I would argue that \"wanting a `File` that does not actually own the descriptor\" is what needs to be fixed.\n\nIt was ugly before and I propagated the uglyness up here.\n\nI think the correct fix to ensure the passed in `dex_fd` is wrapped in `File` as well, and that one should actually own it.",
