      "message": "The point of this CL is to make it so that we can always assume in the OAT file that there is an app image, in order to enable some of the optimizations like removing HLoadClass for classes in the image that are discussed at http://b/38313278.\n\nI agree this is a change in policy, and it\u0027s worth having a discussion about whether this is what we want. That\u0027s part of what the CL is for - to give us something to debate.\n\nMy understanding is we pretty much always have an app image these days, so it shouldn\u0027t be a huge change in practice to require one.",
