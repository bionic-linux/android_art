      "message": "That\u0027s a good question. On my local testing device, you don\u0027t need to be root to read/write in /data/local/tmp. That\u0027s something we could check on our continuous testing devices.\n\nThe current testing set-up expects to run as root at the moment anyway, so I made the assumption that the chroot dir had to be \"somewhere under /data\" when I started working on chroot-based testing (we currently use /data/local/art-test-chroot as ART_TEST_CHROOT). This is something we could revisit when we start trying to run our tests as a non-root user (b/38000545).",
