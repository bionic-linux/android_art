Before the call to artQuickGenericJniTrampoline, this is a full pointer for simplicity, as we do not need a working quick frame at that point.\n\nThe C function will then rearrange things. For example, the handle scope will be inserted between the float saves and the method, we put down the method pointer as a stack reference, and we register the frame as the current top of the managed stack.",
