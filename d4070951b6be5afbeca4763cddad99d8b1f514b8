      "message": "You can also handle PC relative code for 32 bit mode if store_method_addr_ is true.  You will have to set store_method_addr_used_ if you use it.   It isn\u0027t quite PC relative.  It is relative to the start of the method.  Might need some tweaking.\n\nYou can update utility_x86.cc in AnalyzeMIR if you want to check the MIR to see if you need to set this.  Currently, it is only set for 32 bit float constants.",
