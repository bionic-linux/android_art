There are two possible opb type situations:\n - opb type size is less than 32-bit: even with the typo, the situation will be handled properly by IsNarrowerOperands() below.\n - opb type \u003d\u003d int64: this is not possible because the opa would have been promoted to int64 as well, due to JAVA binary operation integer promotion rules.",
