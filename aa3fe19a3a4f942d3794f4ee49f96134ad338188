      "message": "The problem is this. \nAs this is a host binary, we shall include BUILD_HOST_EXECUTABLE\nOnly then it can trigger the logic in core/binary.mk:\nhttps://source.corp.google.com/android/build/make/core/binary.mk;l\u003d1174\n\nThere are 2 issues:\n1. BUILD_HOST_EXECUTABLE is deprecated, though there is a way to override it:\nhttps://source.corp.google.com/android/build/make/core/deprecation.mk;l\u003d28\n\n2. The build will fail due to some collision, e.g.,\nart/build/Android.gtest.mk:59: error: overriding commands for target `out/host/linux-x86/obj/NATIVE_TESTS/art_common_intermediates/art_common.txt\u0027, previously defined at build/make/core/host_executable_internal.mk:43\n\nI think that can be solved with some proper cleanup.",
