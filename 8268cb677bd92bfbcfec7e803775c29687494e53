      "message": "I\u0027ve started to use this in other places in ART. I believe increasing/decreasing indentation of a non-trivial block of preprocessor directives (following the nesting of #if/#ifdef/#ifndef statements) makes it easier to follow the logic. In the present case, I had started to annotate some statements to help me see the nesting, until I decide to indent â€“ which is what we naturally do with non-preprocessor code.\n\nI\u0027ve used the convention of a single-space indentation per level, which I have seen in some other C/C++ projects. Last time I checked, this style was considered acceptable under our C++ guidelines. (I do agree this style would be a bit overkill for trivial preprocessor pieces of code and would not recommend it in those cases.)",

      "message": "we have a similar problem in bionic... we [i] start indenting when things start to get complicated, but then there is this weird style mismatch because our default style is all-in-column-0. i sometimes wish we just used the indentation everywhere. (i\u0027ve abandoned all hope of just \"not having preprocessor cruft complicated enough to warrant indentation\", though hopefully the impending death of GCC [in the NDK] should mean that i can remove some of the layers of conditionals at least.)\n\ndoes anyone know if we can tell clang-format to do this?",
