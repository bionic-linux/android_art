      "message": "The major reason for this peeling was vectorization of \"for (int i \u003d 0; a !\u003d null \u0026\u0026 i \u003c a.length; i++)\" flavored loops. The CL, as is, won\u0027t do that yet, due to a phase ordering issue. So two questions, (1) how hard would it be to do the peeling as part of a prior phase? and (2) if (1) is too hard, then we should think of breaking up the loop optimizer into smaller parts, with SIMD running a bit more downstream.",
