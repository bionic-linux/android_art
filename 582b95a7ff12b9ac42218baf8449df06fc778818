And it will make it harder to do real pointer compression, which I still expect we will need to do at some point. so that the heap isn\u0027t confined to the low 4GB. I still think that as a next step, it\u0027s better to move to 2 parallel arrays, with either 4 or 8 bits for the sequence number.\n\nIt was actually always either 2 (production) or 3 (debug build) bits.",
