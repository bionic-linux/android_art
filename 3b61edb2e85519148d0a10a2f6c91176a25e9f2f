      "message": "Actually, we do want to increase alignment to 8 to avoid the `object` and `index` ending up on different cache lines. We achieve that by arena allocations which always have alignment 8 but it would be nice to still have the alignment documented here.\n\nMaybe we should just modernize this to `alignas(8)`. Similar for `NativeDexCachePair` with 2*pointer_size alignment.\n\nThe macro `PACKED` actually adds two attributes, `__aligned__(x)` and `__packed__`. The latter is really useless for the `DexCachePair`.",
