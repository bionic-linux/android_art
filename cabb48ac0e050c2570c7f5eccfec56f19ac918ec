Given the use in `ADexFile_create` I take it that it\u0027s ok to not open all of them if the dex file is only used for stack unwinding, but presumably it\u0027s not safe in some other situations?",

      "message": "It is always safe to open just one dex file (it is equivalent to opening just one dex file form zip)\n\nThe reason for the CHECK in the other overload is that it might be unexpected from the caller (i.e. the other dex files might have java code that is used by this dex file).\n\nIt is there to make debugging of issues such as this CTS test more explicit / easier.",
