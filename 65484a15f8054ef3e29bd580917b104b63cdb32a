      "message": "Backward compatibility is not a concern for cache-info.xml because this change will be part of an ART update eventually and we need to recompile everything anyway when ART is updated.\n\nWe can add a new element for standalone jars, but then we will have non-trivial amount of duplicate code for checking/generating classpath jar entries and standalone jar entries separately. Due to how the API generated by tinyxml is shaped, I don\u0027t see a way to avoid the duplication.\n\nTo me, classpath jars and standalone jars are almost the same in their nature, while the only difference is how they are loaded at runtime, so it\u0027s probably fine to put them in the same xml element. WDYT?",

      "message": "Yes, it\u0027s true that systemserverclasspath jars and standalone jars come from two different lists. However, odrefresh treats them in almost the same way, except for how the class loader context is constructed, so keeping them in the same xml element still makes sense to me. I would prefer to keep it as is for now. We can always make adjustments in the future when the other way is more preferable because we don\u0027t have to worry about backward compatibility.",
