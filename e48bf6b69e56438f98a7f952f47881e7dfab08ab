      "message": "Hi Nicolas. Sorry it\u0027s taken a little while to come back on this. Unfortunately LLVM\u0027s integrated assembler is not very well documented - it is simply stated to be \"extremely compatible\" with the GNU assembler, for which the directive is supported and properly documentated: https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/Macro.html#index-_005c_0040.\n\nThe directive was added to the LLVM integrated assembler in this commit from 2015 https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/217116e684550545f88e45a0c7411153dcccf1ee which has been merged since Clang 3.7. So I think it should be available for use in this case to avoid the magic numbers / potential for clashing labels?",
