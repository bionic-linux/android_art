      "message": "Lokesh -\n\nDo you understand why the garbage collection task itself does not simply hold a mutex during the GC, to prevent multiple concurrent GCs?\n\nWe do only allow one GC at a time. But the mechanism for doing that seems needlessly complicated, involving gc_complete_lock, and a field protected by it. We seem to be emulating a mutex with a mutex. This CL attempts to document a little better what we do, but I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s necessary.",
