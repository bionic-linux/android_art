      "message": "This is mostly a repetition of the text for the testing ART APEX above, which brings more risk of getting stale. I suggest removing this from both sections and add a new one named something like \"Limiting ART gtests execution\" that describes it in general.\n\nAs a point in case, the subtle GTest vs ArtGTest difference I suspect is actually intentional since you\u0027re adding this now. But when the rest of the text is copied it is easy to suspect it was a typo, so it\u0027s better to join them to one description and instead call that out explicitly.",
