      "message": "You are right, we should move the strerror below for safety. Though my reading of the manual is that you must call strerror to change the value (just setting errno is not enough):\n\nThe string pointed to shall not be modified by the application, but may be overwritten by a subsequent call to strerror()\n\nI can\u0027t find an occurrence of that in ReadFileToString or called functions.\n\n\nIan asked me to do this change before posting his bug. He wanted const char* to avoid the memory allocation of std::string. That\u0027s why I changed your PS.",
