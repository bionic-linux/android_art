However doing so does look like it would be pretty annoying (lots of added cases).\n\nMostly though if we are going to work-around it here we should do as small a change from current behavior as necessary (i.e. just don\u0027t let this return 0). Furthermore making this just not return 0 is a pretty trivial change so it\u0027s not like this is making him re-write a ton of stuff.",
