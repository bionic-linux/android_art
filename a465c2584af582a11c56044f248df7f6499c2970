      "message": "This helps chroot builds and tests work with banchan which uses module_\u003carch\u003e products. However, there are still some snags:\n\n- libcrypto in external/boringssl and liblzma in external/lzma don\u0027t build since they specify sdk_version (b/187288515).\n- 32 bit gtests don\u0027t work on 64 bit Cuttlefish due to missing system/lib/libprocessgroup.so in the chroot. When I compare to a successful run on an armv8 device I see the latter lacks a lot more 32 bit libs, but otoh it doesn\u0027t push the 32 bit gtests at all there, so maybe it shouldn\u0027t do that on x86_64 Cuttlefish either.\n\nAnyway, that\u0027s for later.",
