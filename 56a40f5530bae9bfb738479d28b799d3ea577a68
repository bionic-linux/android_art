Also, it feels odd to get this dangling mirror::Class line 2621 and then put it in a handler in a branch.\n\nI haven\u0027t authored any class linker code anyway, but a consistent story on when and why things are in a handle really helps. Igor, that\u0027s also something you could consider adding to the style (and semantic?) guide.",
