      "message": "You have removed the transition weight, which is fairly large factor.\n\nI am not a fan of the random additional fudge hotness bumps, but I assume they were added for a reason once upon a time.\n\nI am ok with trying to remove them (furthermore I guess literally removing this code might make more sense then trying to reduce large fudge to 1).\n\nHowever, we should probably leave that to separate CL and carefully measure performance changes there. (given the code change to keep it alive is trivial)",
