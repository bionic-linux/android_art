      "message": "Should be 17. (Also update timeout_dumper, please)\n\nProbably it\u0027s best if this is consistent with timeout_dumper, in general.\n\n(My long-term plan was to use timeout_dumper similar to how we tombstoned is used on device, and remove all symbolization from ART proper. The main issue are internal abort dumps, though.)",

      "message": "Done.\n\nOne of my major annoyances with backtraces is all the extra frames on top of the crash which makes it painful to find the actual crashed frame.  I would rather let the ART process die properly, and let the calling process deal with the backtrace (likely using pure libbacktrace\u0026libunwind).  Is that pretty much what you have in mind?",
