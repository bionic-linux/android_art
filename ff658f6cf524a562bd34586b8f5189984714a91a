      "message": "This isn\u0027t a strong point, but in terms of the test output we see as the tests run, using a different name (instead of \"SpaceTest\", something like \"LargeObjectSpaceTest\") here may be a good idea (same for rosalloc_space and dlmalloc_space) because using a different name would give the (correct) impression that they are in different test files and hence parallelized. Otherwise, it could lead to a wrong impression that they aren\u0027t parallelized.\n\nWe could do this easily by having an (almost) empty subclass of SpaceTest here and let LargeObjecTest() belong to it. It\u0027s a good idea to move the body of LargeObjectTest() here as well.",
