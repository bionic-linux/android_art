      "message": "Hi Xueliang,\n\nThe latest patch set has passed all presubmit tests and the new VIXL simulator tests (28% coverage), so this CL is close to be merged. Can you check that my changes didn\u0027t break things on ARM side? In particular, I removed SIMULATOR_TARGET_OUT and replaced it with ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT that I think is always set with `source build/envsetup.sh`. But this may affect your workflow.\n\nThe summary of other changes I did on top of your PS3 (you can see it by choosing \"PS3\" instead of \"Base\" in Gerrit diff UI):\n\n- For interpreter-only mode, set native entrypoints only if running under simulator, otherwise interpreter tests fail (in runtime/class_linker.cc)\n- Disable codegen gtest under emulator, as the emulator requires started runtime and gtests run without runtime (in compiler/optimizing/codegen_test_utils.h)\n- Rearranged Android.bp files to avoid collision in debug and non-debug libraries, added missing include directory\n- Added simulator libs in build/apex/art_apex_test.py (script that checks APEX contents)\n- Fixed some debug checks (in runtime/entrypoints_order_test.cc)\n- Changed SIMULATOR_TARGET_OUT to ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT\n- Disabled more run-tests, as they now hit illegal instruction\n- Use boot.art instead of core.art\n\nLet me know if PS11 works for you.\n",

      "message": "Hi Ulya,\nYour changes look good to me. PS11 works on my side (with the same 28% passrate).\nUsing ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT is OK, however I found I need to use a slightly different boot.art path to make it work (see my comment in run-test).\n\nOverall, I think this CL is more polished, it\u0027ll be great to see this feature land in ART.\n\nThanks\nXueliang",

      "message": "I\u0027ve tested, using ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT is OK. However the boot.art path that works in my env is:\n\n   \"${ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT}/system/apex/com.android.art.testing/javalib/boot.art\"\n                          ^^^^^^^^\n\nBy the way, I found when ART/dex2oat cannot find the correct boot image given by --boot, the error message is very confusing and hard to link to incorrect path error.
