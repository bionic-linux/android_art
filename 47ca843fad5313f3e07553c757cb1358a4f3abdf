      "message": "This was previously just setting a pointer. You\u0027ve hooked into that to do some extra work for JIT and this invalidates assumptions made by many of its callers. In addition to `ImageSpace` here, you should also update `ImageWriter` and `OatWriter`. (There may be no JIT in `dex2oat` but these uses really just want to set a pointer.)\n\nI\u0027d prefer to revert `SetEntryPointFromQuickCompiledCode()` to simply set the pointer. You should define a different function that reflects the JIT update in its name and use it where appropriate.",
