      "message": "It\u0027s a known issue that Nexus 4 misreports supporting at least divide via /proc/cpuinfo and so there is a more accurate system property. In general CppDefines should be more accurate, assuming the build for the device was configured properly. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if LPAE were misreported in /proc/cpuinfo for devices. If CppDefines aren\u0027t working well for you I imagine you are looking at emulator/pass-through performance and the fix there may be to fix the emulator build. Or make this change conditional on being an emulator build.",
