      "message": "Thank you, Hans,\n\nSeems like it failed in the second run too. I\u0027m thinking - as it also fails for the parent commit (https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/art/+/2767953/11) which changes mem_map.h - maybe the particular test is triggered by a change in the file (even though possibly would\u0027ve failed even if run without any changes).\n\nOr, alternatively, maybe the problem is with adding \"bit_utils.h\" or \"globals.h\" header to the mem_map.h; however, I\u0027ve not yet figured out how exactly that might cause the issue.",
