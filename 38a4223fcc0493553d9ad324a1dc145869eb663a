I know I certainly do.\n\nIt\u0027s much easier to remember to use Art::Pretty?? and look into utils.h when debugging then having to dig across 10 different files.\n\nSo I would recommend leaving these here even if it just calls the code in the new refactored locations, it will make debugging easier.",

      "message": "As I told you in person, I believe the implementations belong with the respective classes, and as far as the free or static method is concerned, I think having it in the class is preferable.  If we want it in one place, we can add another layer like you suggest in a separate CL.",
