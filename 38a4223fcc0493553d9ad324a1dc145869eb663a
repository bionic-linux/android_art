I know I certainly do.\n\nIt\u0027s much easier to remember to use Art::Pretty?? and look into utils.h when debugging then having to dig across 10 different files.\n\nSo I would recommend leaving these here even if it just calls the code in the new refactored locations, it will make debugging easier.",
