      "message": "This only started failing when the SDK snapshot got prebuilts of these libraries, because the snapshot adds some apex_available entries without retaining the implicit //apex_available:platform we get here when there\u0027s no apex_available list  at all.\n\nI guess the consistent thing is to add //apex_available:platform to the prebuilts in that situation (although I\u0027d rather we didn\u0027t have that implicit rule at all). WDYT, should we add that to the SDK snapshot generation?",
