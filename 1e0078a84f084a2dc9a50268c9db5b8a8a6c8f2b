Is that ok?\n\nI assume the set is typically small, otherwise this insertion/deletion is not very efficient. What is the possible range of type IDs in those type references?\n\nAlso note that you can avoid erase and get back the range-for loop if you use a second set to gather new/remaining references and swap between iterations.",
