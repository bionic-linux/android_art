      "message": "So this is a comment about using `ScotedTrace trace(__FUNCTION__)` in general, in addition to this specific case, but I think we should discourage this usage in our codebase.  1) If there is a similarly named function somewhere else we won\u0027t be able to distinguish them; 2) there are currently a bunch of slices for `operator()` because of calls like this, which doesn\u0027t add any information to the trace; 3) And for functions with parameters the types get added, creating very long and busy log lines.\n\nThis is just my opinion though, so do what you feel is best.",
