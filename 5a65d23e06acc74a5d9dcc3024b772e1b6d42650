The issue is correctly throwing exceptions, which FindClassInPathClassLoader delegates to the actual class-loader (if we fail to load something in fast-path, we\u0027ll just call the Java code) - which is obviously a problem if the class-loader is null.\n\nSo that\u0027s a follow-up CL down the road, but I\u0027m interested in opinions on how to handle that elegantly.",
