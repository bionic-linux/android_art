That is because the dependencies from sdk/module_exports to its source members are not replaced by the prebuilts when they are preferred. See:\nhttp://cs/aosp-master/build/soong/android/prebuilt.go?l\u003d276\n\nI know that we cannot do something similar with APEXes because at the time the dependencies on sources are replaced with dependencies on prebuilts we have no knowledge about APEX membership as those mutators run later. However, I did wonder yesterday whether we could fix the APEX issue by replacing those incorrect dependencies on prebuilts with dependencies on the sources. In effect reversing the effects of the source-\u003eprebuilt replacement for those APEX modules.",

The conditional replacement only affects direct dependencies of the sdk (and some special support for system modules). I suspect that problem is a result of static dependencies of a direct dependency using a prebuilt version of the static library which results in using prebuilt versions of the include dirs. That in turn causes a different set of include dirs to be created for static/shared which pushes the export_include_dirs inside the static/shared structure which fails because that does not support export_include_dirs.\n\nI\u0027ve long thought that the flattening of export include dirs from all the transitive dependencies onto a single list in the sdk member was a problem. It leads to duplicate entries across libraries (which we need special support to detect and ignore).\n\nI think that you\u0027re right that we can\u0027t afford to wait to fix these issues \u0027properly\u0027.",

      "message": "go/module-sdk-prefer-prebuilts is that done properly. Doing some low-effort variant of it in Soong brings the problem of how to identify the modules we want act on. This way it\u0027s clunky but very obvious, and I much rather have it visible in the bp files than either hardcoded in Soong or in an environment variable.
