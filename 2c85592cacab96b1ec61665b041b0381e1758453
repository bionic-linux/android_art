      "message": "was this the signedness difference you were talking about? when Android, the Linux kernel, glibc, the BSDs, and elfutils all agree, i think llvm is wrong even if they\u0027re right :-) in this case, i assume it\u0027s an incorrect assumption on their part about the default signedness of enums.",

      "message": "no the above is becasuse the compiler was complaining about unsigned vs signed with the ternary operator.\n\nNo the original issue was the Elf32_Sword vs Elf32_Word change in https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/97640/3/compiler/elf_writer_quick.h\n\nlinux elf.h says  Elf32_Sword d_val;\nLLVM elf.h says Elf32_Word d_val;\nelfutils says Elf32_Word d_val \nhttp://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch5.dynamic.html says Elf32_Word\td_val;\n\nso linux and therefore bionic seems wrong.",
