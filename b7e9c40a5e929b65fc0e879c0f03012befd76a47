These map.txt files aren\u0027t used as version scripts, only for APEX stubs (hence no strict need for \"# apex\" in them, although that should perhaps be added anyway for clarity).\n\nThese ABIs are solely between ART and platform, and have been in use from at least R (most of them are much older, but I haven\u0027t dug into the history). Of course, up until then they\u0027ve been entirely internal since ART has been part of platform. Platform outside the ART module only uses a subset of the functions, which this cleanup will now reflect.\n\nThe platform dependencies go through the libnative{bridge,loader}_lazy libs which load them dynamically. They were added to paper over a layer inversion through libs like libandroid_runtime in early boot (see https://r.android.com/886995 and its linked tickets). That\u0027s however a side issue, since even if we get rid of those lazy libs we\u0027d have dependencies on these ABIs from the app processes.\n\n\u003e Can we even still make breaks to S?\n\nWell, I argue that it isn\u0027t a break, just a cleanup of superfluous symbols. In any case, that\u0027s a question for the cherry-picks to sc-dev. We\u0027re not there yet, but I\u0027m happy to start that discussion as well now.",
