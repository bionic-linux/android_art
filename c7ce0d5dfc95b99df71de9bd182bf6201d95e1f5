I find it informative and it also acts as a safeguard when new test methods get added that they\u0027re actually being run.\n\nThe color coding on on the \"OK\" (green) and the \"FAILED\" (red) also gives back very quick feedback for test driven development.\n\nQuieting the specific tests that are spammy seems like it should be sufficient.",
