Currently runtime app images don\u0027t have oat code right?\n\nI noticed this when running tests with --debuggable locally. It\u0027s a problem with --speed which generates oat code for all methods. It\u0027s not a problem with boot images because we explicitly deoptimize boot image in debuggable runtimes. I don\u0027t understand the various images too well :).\n\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027s a recent regression though. Also, when we initialize classes we have FixupStaticTrampolines which re-initializes the entry points. So I guess this shouldn\u0027t be a problem in general? We have a DCHECK that checks we don\u0027t have oat code when updating the entrypoints that fails with the speed profile on multiple jvmti tests.",
