Otherwise, I would need to add \"#if !defined(ASM_DEFINE_INCLUDE_DEPENDENCIES)\" to avoid build errors as well as change the Android.bp to export shared libraries. \n\nAlso we cannot currently use heapprofd_api_noop as it seems to be missing \"host_supported: true\" and results in ART build errors. So we are concentrating on the Target build which is where Perfetto exists and is our main usage anyway.",
