I also wanted the default to be the \"old\" \"everything-is-checked\" build (for tests, and in the hopes that we can get back to something that runs all checks yet is usable). So this was a compromise attempt.\n\nI could see where Igor is coming from: It would be nice to be able to find all debug checks quickly. That\u0027s why I adapted the naming. If you have a better suggestion, I\u0027m more than happy to incorporate that.",
