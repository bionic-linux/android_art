I think that\u0027s the only use.\n\nYou\u0027re right it wasn\u0027t introduced in that CL, my mistake. The originator is indeed Dimitry in https://r.android.com/223038, and the stated reason for ro.debuggable is that it\u0027s intended to be available only in test runs with dalvikvm. However I understand from Roland that we may want to change that, so I\u0027ll go ahead with this. Thanks.",
