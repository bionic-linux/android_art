Since the libraries won\u0027t be provided any other way on host, runtime_libs should install its dependencies there, shouldn\u0027t it? It doesn\u0027t seem ideal to have to explicitly add transitive dependencies to packages.",

      "message": "aosp/1702492 is the related change.\n\nFor now, there\u0027s two module types of \"Packaging\": filesystem and cvd-host-package. These are very similar to \"apex\", but it gathers listed dependencies including transitive dependencies if dependency tags tells to do so. (InstallNeededDependencyTag). \n\ncvd-host-package is to collect host tools to run \"cvd(cuttlefish)\" as zip.\n\n\u003e  It doesn\u0027t seem ideal to have to explicitly add transitive dependencies to packages.\n\nYeah, I agree.\n\nWith the current change, I\u0027d like to know if host version of \"libdexfile\" is meaningful. The dependency chain is \"libbacktrace -\u003e libunwindstack -\u003e libdexfile_support -\u003e(dlopen)-\u003e libdexfile\". What would happen if libdexfile is missing? Is it necessary part of the (host) libdexfile_support or accidental dependency?",
