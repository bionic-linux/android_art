This checks the accuracy of double precision division and of some java.lang.Math
functions. It uses the arithmetic package from Google's calculator to compute
exact answers and compare them against the floating point result and nearby
representable floating point values, to determine whether they are within
the promised range. We test mostly pseudo-random values generated from a random
seed. Thus actual bugs may show up as intermittent failures, which should not be
ignored.
