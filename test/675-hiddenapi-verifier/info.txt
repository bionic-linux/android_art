Test that dex files with hidden API flags are rejected by the DexFileVerifier.
This is because hidden API flags use invalid combinations of flags to encode
the information, but should only be used by boot class path. We verify boot
class path dex files before their flags are modified and boot jars built and
should reject any other dex files with hidden flags as invalid.
