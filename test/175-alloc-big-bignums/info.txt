Allocate large numbers of huge BigIntegers in rapid succession. Most of the
associated memory wil be in the C++ heap. This makes sure that we trigger
the garbage colllector often enough to prevent us from running out of memory.

This test is a lot nastier than it looks. In particular, failure on target tends
to kill off all processes on the device, including the adb daemon :-( .
