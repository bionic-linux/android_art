Regression test for bad handling of package name containing a character outside
the BMP plane. For a proxy class with a non-public interface in such a package,
this caused the package name comparison to fail because the dex file encoding
had two three-byte sequences while the descriptor was encoded with a four-byte
sequence, leading to IllegalArgumentException when calling a proxy method via
the interface.
