             *         public void foo() { ... }
             *     }
             *     class Test1Derived extends Test1Base {
             *         private void foo() { ... }
             *         ...
             *     }
             * Tested invokes:
             *     invoke-direct  Test1Derived.foo()V   from Test1Derived in first dex file
             *     invoke-virtual Test1Derived.foo()V   from Test1User    in second dex file
             *     invoke-virtual Test1Derived.foo()V   from Test1User2   in first dex file
             *
             * Previously, the behavior was very odd because the lookups for direct and
             * virtual methods were independent but results were stored in a single slot
             * in the DexCache method array and then retrieved from there without checking
             * the resolution kind. Thus, the first invoke-direct stored the private
             * Test1Derived.foo() in the DexCache and the attempt to use invoke-virtual
             * from the same dex file (by Test1User2) would throw ICCE. However, the same
             * invoke-virtual from a different dex file (by Test1User) would ignore the
             * direct method Test1Derived.foo() and find the Test1Base.foo() and call it.
             *
             * The method lookup has been changed and we now consistently find the private
             * Derived.foo() and throw ICCE for both invoke-virtual calls.
             *
             * Note that for the Java files to compile the test case, we need Test1User
             * and Test1User2 to see the class Test1Derived defining a public foo()V but
             * we need a different Test1Derived with a private foo()V for the final test,
             * so we define Test1Derived in src/ and src2/. The Test1Derived in src2/ with
             * private foo()V () needs to derive from a Test1Base class that defines a
             * public foo()V in the final test but it cannot reduce its visibility and
             * therefore needs to be compiled with a Test1Base that does not define it,
             * so we define Test1Base in src2/ and src3/. Files:
             *   src/Test1User2.java         - calls invoke-virtual Test1Derived.foo().
             *   src-multidex/Test1User.java - calls invoke-virtual Test1Derived.foo().
             *   src/Test1Derived.java       - defines public foo()V, not used in the test.
             *   src2/Test1Derived.java      - defines private foo()V, calls it with invoke-direct.
             *   src2/Test1Base.java         - does not define foo()V, not used in the test.
             *   src3/Test1Base.java         - defines public foo()V.
