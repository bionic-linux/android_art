      "message": "PS4 is rebased and slightly reworked. Changes since PS3:\n\n- use the ART boot image in the testing APEX com.android.art.testing instead of the former core.art\n- make a few tweaks to make art-apex-tester pass the check (it checks the contents of the ART APEX which now contain additional libs for the simulator)\n- fix a typo in README.simulator.md\n- disable a few more tests that crash ART with \"illegal instruction\"\n\nOtherwise the test specified in commit message passed locally for targets aosp_arm64-userdebug and aosp_walleye-userdebug. I\u0027m starting presubmit and more tests.\n\nDavid, Martin, Roland, Vladimir: PTAL (I\u0027m going to merge this if the tests are in order).",
