      "message": "The original thought was that as this is exposed as Java (signed) int on the Java side (java/lang/Class.java), (signed) int32_t would be better. But I see the other fields are uint32_t which are int on the Java side. Will change it to uint32_t to be consistent.\n\nAnd agree about 8 bits for each.",
