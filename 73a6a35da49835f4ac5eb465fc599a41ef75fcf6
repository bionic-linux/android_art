      "message": "Would you please extend the comment a bit, making clear what\u0027s redundant and why?\n\nI had to spend a bit of time thinking through this and making sure I understood it (I was concerned we\u0027re missing an update and exception traces would be wrong, but now I understand that mterp already wrote the dex pc in).\n\n\nThe following is up for discussion:\n\nTracing is normally off, anyways. So the TraceExecution is for all intents and purposes a nop, and I don\u0027t think it needs to be avoided.\n\nIn that case, you can rewrite your\n\n do {\n   if (x) { a }\n   ...\n } until (y);\n a;\n\nto be\n\n if (x) { a }\n do {\n   ...\n   a;\n } until (y);\n\nThat would avoid the branch in the loop. Given, it\u0027s a micro-op, and mterp is the future, but still...",

      "message": "Thinking about this a little more, I think it\u0027s probably best just to lose the \"if () {}\" altogether.  I inserted this code when I use using a templated version of the switch interpreter for single-stepping, so at the time it added zero cost to the switch interpreter.  Once mterp is fleshed out for a target, the single-step case is a very rare slow path.  So, redundantly setting dex_pc is of little consequence.  But, as the code stands now it does add useless work to the common case of the switch version.\n\nChanging to remove the !interpret_one_instruction test and unconditionally doing the update.",
