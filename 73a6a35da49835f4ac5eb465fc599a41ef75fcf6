So the TraceExecution is for all intents and purposes a nop, and I don\u0027t think it needs to be avoided.\n\nIn that case, you can rewrite your\n\n do {\n   if (x) { a }\n   ...\n } until (y);\n a;\n\nto be\n\n if (x) { a }\n do {\n   ...\n   a;\n } until (y);\n\nThat would avoid the branch in the loop.
