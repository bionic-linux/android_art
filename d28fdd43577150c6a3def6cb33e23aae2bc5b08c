      "message": "This CL regenerates ART test files and adds:\n- build support for 18 ART run-tests; and\n- run-time support for 8 tests among these 18 run-tests.\n\nTherefore, the new changes brought by this CL are:\n\n  * 18 new Blueprint files for the 18 ART run-tests (build support);\n  * 16 (2 Ã— 8) new entries in `TEST_MAPPING` (run-time support):\n    * 8 new entries for Mainline presubmits (`mainline-presubmit` test group);\n    * 8 new entries for \"usual\" presubmits (`presubmit` test group).\n\nYou\u0027ll also note that the 8 tests supported both at build- and run-time (mentioned in the commit message) use the `art-run-test-target-template` test configuration template (enabling them in non-test-mapping-based continuous testing), while the 10 other tests use the `art-run-test-target-no-test-suite-tag-template` test configuration template (which disables them in non-test-mapping-based continuous testing).\n\nDoes that make sense?",
