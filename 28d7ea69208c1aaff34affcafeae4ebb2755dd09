      "message": "I\u0027m a bit surprised that all apps are allowed to load `ProductSharedLib` in /product/framework and `VendorSharedLib` in /vendor/framework, and only the system apps are then restricted from loading the respective native libs through them. Jiyong, is this WAI?\n\nIt could be that the fixture setup in `pushSharedLib` in LibnativeloaderTest.java is wonky.\n\nIt\u0027s not the goal of this test to check access from apps to shared libraries in different partitions, so I may just delete these variants, but I thought it warranted a question.\n\nI should note that the hostside test does `setenforce 0`, but that only enables loading of `/vendor/lib(64)/libvendor_private*.so`. It has no other effects.",
