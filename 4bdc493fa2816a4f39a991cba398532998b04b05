      "message": "I am using few unused bits from flags to specify which version we need. I don\u0027t know if we need additional checks here, like API level or something that makes sure we use these bits only above a certain version. \n\nAll the unused bits are set to 0 when starting method tracing using ```am profile start``` (which is also used by Android Studio) so it should be safe. Though VMDebug.startMethodTracing is a public API and I guess it isn\u0027t possible to make sure the unused bits are 0. If they are set to some other value, then we may generate a different format than expected. I don\u0027t think VMDebug.startMethodTracing is used much though.",
