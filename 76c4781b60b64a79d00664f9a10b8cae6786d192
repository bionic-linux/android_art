      "message": "I was considering it at some point since it will probably make things a tiny more straightforward when I\u0027ll add dalvikvm support.\n\nDecided to go with a separate options because:\n1) it adds clarity that it\u0027s not a regular \"-cp\" that one might expect\n2) it simplifies the parsing and error reporting. Assuming that we fallback to parse a \"regular\" classpath we would still need a way to tell that\u0027s a malformed one. e.g. maybe we failed because the class loader type is wrong, or the wrong separator were used. It adds quite a bit of corner cases.\n\nI can be convinced otherwise.",
