It\u0027s not obvious that this change speeds up the build (although it generally makes sense).\n\nHow/when are the tests sharded? Is it decided ahead of time or just before the build? If the latter, then why not adjust shard count / the number of tests in each in case we have only a few tests to rebuild (and then make them always single-threaded)?",
