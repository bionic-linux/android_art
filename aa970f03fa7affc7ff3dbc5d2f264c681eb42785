It\u0027s not obvious that this change speeds up the build (although it generally makes sense).\n\nHow/when are the tests sharded? Is it decided ahead of time or just before the build? If the latter, then why not adjust shard count / the number of tests in each in case we have only a few tests to rebuild (and then make them always single-threaded)?",

      "message": "For the record.\n\nAfter an offline discussion we think that the best way would be to write Go code in Soong that would process one Android.bp module containing all art tests and generate individual Ninja rule for each test. This way Soong build graph would not be bloated, but it would be possible to rebuild precisely what\u0027s needed (not more) when modifying individual tests.\n\nWhile we don\u0027t have it, next best thing is sharding.\n\nThis patch has an observable effect of making the workstation more responsive while building all art tests at once, so it makes sense to accept it.",
