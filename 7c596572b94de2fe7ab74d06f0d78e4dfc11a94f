      "message": "Good point about device. This can be expanded to check via adb shell command how many cores are on device.\n\nI think it should default to host CPU count on host however. I think we just want to run all tests ASAP and not type out extra -j args every time.",

      "message": "So, there are two things - build and run.\nIn case of build(invoking the make command), we can use the cpu count and for running the test, concurrency can be decided by the number of cpus.\n\nI am working on a change to use multiprocess instead of multithreads as the former seems to be faster. I can accommodate the above suggestion in it as well.",
