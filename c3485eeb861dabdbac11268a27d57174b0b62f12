We can have the same (short)(char-data) situation, making this a perfectly fine signed abs!\n\nAbs and SAD are the ones I called \"implicitly\" signed.\n\n(I was pondering on given them IsUnsigned -\u003e false method to make that more clear, but with the direction that we are going now that would be a waste).\n\n\nalternatively, you could do the normalize packed data type trick for abs in the loop opt if you prefer",

      "message": "Something like \n\n  static void vmarko(char[] y) {\n    for (int i \u003d 0; i \u003c 10; i++) {\n      y[i] \u003d (char) Math.abs((short)y[i]);\n    }\n  }\n\nvectorizes, but leaves unsigned packed data types on the ABS (just because vectorizer only cares about data width, the operations themselves reflect signed/unsignedness). The current code will LOG FATAL on that! (incidentally, the CL that I send out for review fixes this by being cleaner in the type, anticipating the direction we are taking now).\n\nI will send out a unit test to make sure we watch these cases better.\n\nSo I am okay with removing the unsigned type here, but for the moment, you should call NormalizePackedType() with the (always false) is_unsigned variable in loop_optimization.cc at L1747 right before creating HVecAbs() to ensure the packed data types always reflect the is-signed-ness. Very much like you did for Min/Max/SAD",
