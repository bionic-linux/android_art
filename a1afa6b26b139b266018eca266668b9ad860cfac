      "message": "All this \"push\" boilerplate is unfortunate, and the proliferation of test XML files is also a maintenance problem by themselves. I presume these \"push\" elements are the reason the template XML files cannot be used anymore.\n\nIs there a ticket to improve things to avoid them? Or else, maybe we should consider extending the template approach to autogenerate this stuff with a genrule? I rather hope this won\u0027t be around for too long.\n\nIn particular, what happens if we add new tests with jars and forget them in this list? Will we get errors?",
