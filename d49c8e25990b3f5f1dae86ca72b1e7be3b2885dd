You\u0027re not expected to review this, but you can if you want to.\n\nThe \"classes-tmp-all\" (referenced by \"src-tmp-all\") is used for compiling many things together to serve as a classpath for compilation of individual components later (allows cross-references). But those components can be loaded differently at runtime, so those classes may or may not be visible. (And there\u0027s also the overriding with src2/, src-art/ and src-ex2/.)",
