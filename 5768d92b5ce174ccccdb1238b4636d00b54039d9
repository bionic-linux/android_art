      "message": "Thanks for the patches! We had a few discussions with Martin and Jiakai who know build system much better than I do. I will add them to the three CLs. They will be happy to provide high level feedback now. They are busy with Android release currently and can do a in-depth review maybe in June. Hope that\u0027s okay with you. \n\nOne more question here, I was looking at an old doc on how to build and test simulator and that refers to a art/test/README.simulator.md. I couldn\u0027t find it any of the patches or already checked in to the repo. Could you please point me to the Readme please?",
