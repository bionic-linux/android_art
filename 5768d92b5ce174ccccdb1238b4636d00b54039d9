They will be happy to provide high level feedback now. They are busy with Android release currently and can do a in-depth review maybe in June. Hope that\u0027s okay with you. \n\nOne more question here, I was looking at an old doc on how to build and test simulator and that refers to a art/test/README.simulator.md. I couldn\u0027t find it any of the patches or already checked in to the repo. Could you please point me to the Readme please?",

Hope that\u0027s okay with you.\n\nSounds great, thanks!\n\n\u003e Could you please point me to the Readme please?\n\nSure, it\u0027s part of the [Stage 1 simulator support patch](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/art/+/2680028/3/test/README.simulator.md).\n\nTo give you some more context about building and testing the simulator; the reason we haven\u0027t updated that old document or marked the simulator specific patches (marked \"[Sim]\") ready for review yet, is because [this patch](https://github.com/Linaro/vixl/pull/93) is needed in VIXL to support implicit checks in ART. Once that patch is merged we will update the simulator guide document and the rest of the simulator patches will be available for review and testing.",

The target boot image is built separately as part of [[Sim] Build target boot image for simulator](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/art/+/2680024/3).\n\n\u003e One more question, The boot image should be targeted to arm64 right? We don\u0027t need the x86_64 boot image right?\n\nYes the arm64 boot image is used and the x86_64 boot image is built as part of the host build but ignored.\n\nNote: we intentionally chose to use the existing host and target builds within the ART testing infrastructure to keep the simulator build as close to regular production builds as possible. This way there are only a few small changes specific to the simulator inside the ART test scripts.",
