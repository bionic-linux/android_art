      "message": "I rebased the old CL to read timestamp counters directly from JITed code. I didn\u0027t land this back then so I could add mrrc instruction to ARM vixl. I would like to land this and add the mrrc instruction to vixl in a follow up CL. That way, we won\u0027t be blocked on this CL for doing some performance measurements and few more optimizations that are on pipeline. I opened a bug and add a TODO so I won\u0027t miss it. I plan to work on mrrc in a couple of weeks.\n\nThere are some minor changes (adding a TODO and some changes to test since that has changed a lot since the initial revision). The changes are in PS11-\u003ePS13. PTAL. Thanks!",
