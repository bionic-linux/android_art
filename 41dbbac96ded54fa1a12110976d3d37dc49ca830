Note that I added comments to a couple of existing functions, which I believe correctly describe the operation of those functions as currently implemented. It would be good for Lokesh, Mathieu, and Roland to see whether they\u0027re consistent with the assumptions made by callers; I\u0027m not sure.\n\nAlso if somebody has an idea on how to avoid copying potentially dead referents (as discussed in the commit message and comments) without increasing Copy() cost, that would be very welcome. Note that PS2 was my best, but I now believe incorrect, attempt to do that. But I don\u0027t think that\u0027s necessary to solve the main problem here; we can get by with the read barrier.",

      "message": "This was basically what PS2 attempted to do, though probably in a suboptimal way. But I think it requires a Copy() fix, with possibly measurable negative performance implications.\n\nCurrently, if you look at Copy() in concurrent_copying.cc, I think it basically does:\n\nmemcpy, filling in object;\nrelease fence;\na: Relaxed CAS to fill in forwarding address;\nPushOntoMarkStack(...);\nb: return to-space-reference;\n\nThe CASes to the same address occur in a single total order, but that\u0027s not related to the order in which other things become visible; it\u0027s just that modifications to a single location always occur in a single total order in C++. By the C++ rules, there is nothing ordering (a) and (b). Thus the CAS can appear to be arbitrarily delayed, including delaying it past a CAS in another thread that saw the to-space-reference. I\u0027m not sure that breaks anything, since everything still needs to be locally consistent, i.e. the delayed CAS is now the one that should fail.\n\nAt the object-code level, this maybe can\u0027t actually happen because the architecture guarantees that the store of to-space-reference that communicates it to another thread can\u0027t be speculative. But I don\u0027t think that\u0027s really sufficient either: I think the architecture allows the load-exclusive to complete, and the store-exclusive to compute its result, without actually making the store-exclusive visible. At that point no other thread can update the forwarding pointer, because we have the cache line holding it, but other stores from this thread can become visible.\n\nSo my reading is that using IsMarked() here would currently be broken.\n\nWe can fix that by using a release CAS instead of the relaxed CAS and moving the fence down. Which is less expensive than I initially thought. I\u0027m coming around to just doing that; the logic in other parts of the collector seems too subtle without that. I\u0027d be happier to do it if I could convince myself that the current code is really broken.\n\nUnless I hear otherwise, I\u0027ll use IsMarked()/Copy() with the Copy() fix.",

Based on the C++ spec, there is essentially a total order for all accesses to the same location, in this case to obj-\u003efwd_ptr, and the read access associated with a CAS must see the last write (in that order) before the CAS write. So one of the CASs has to fail. What\u0027s not ordered is the store to the CAS and the possible publication of the result. Or the CAS and any other memory accesses to different locations.\n\nAt the ARM level, exclusive memory operations provide the same guarantee. (Or in v8.1+, there\u0027s a direct implementation that I believe we currently don\u0027t use.)\n\nControl dependencies have a very limited effect on ordering in ARM, and currently none in C++ (due to possible compiler elimination of dependencies). Basically a store that is control-dependent on a load cannot be reordered before the load. Control-dependent loads can be reordered with each other due to branch prediction. I don\u0027t find anything in the documentation that introduces a control dependency from any kind of store, including a store-exclusive. So I don\u0027t think the store-exclusive in the CAS is ordered with respect to a potential subsequent publishing store of e.g. objA. See B2.3.3 in the ARMv8 spec.

The load can appear anywhere in the sequence of accesses to fwd_ptr. Accesses to global are not included in the total order for fwd_pointer; they have their own total access order (normally called coherence order).",

      "message": "My concern with the scenario in my previous comment was that thread B took decision of CAS based on thread A\u0027s assumption that A\u0027s CAS has succeeded. Now isn\u0027t it possible that \n\nthread A does exclusive load of fwd_ptr\nthread A stores objA to global\nthread B does exclusive load of fwd_ptr\nthread B does exclusive store of fwd_ptr\nthread A attempts exclusive store of fwd_ptr, which fails.\n\nSo in this case only one of the CAS has succeeded, as you said. But not the right one!\n\n\nAnyways, what if you we were to do the following in refersTo():\n\nif the referent is marked (in to-space or in unevac space but marked) then nothing to worry.\nelse, if referent has a forwarding pointer, then also nothing worry. It must be to the right one!\nelse, if referent has no forwarding pointer, we attempt a CAS with the loaded value (non-forwarded lock-word). If the CAS fails, then we\u0027ll get the to-space ref and hence comparison will be straight-forward. Otherwise, referent can\u0027t be equal to other.\nBasically, with this, we create a TSO, without impacting Copy() performance. WDYT?\n\nOne thing we must ensure is that if GC is running during refersTo(), then it shouldn\u0027t declare marking finished. Because in the reclaim phase, we will get rid of the whole from-space.",
