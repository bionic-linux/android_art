      "message": "Okay, so I am not familiar with the HIR yet. But in MIR, I prefer side effects for anything with memory effects, thread effect, etc. And thus things like branches don\u0027t get captured as having side effects, they have well defined behavior. Therefore having a check for HasDefs allows keeping instructions that fall in this bucket because clearly if it defines nothing, it must have some semantic meaning. :)\n\nAnyway, from looking later in patch I see branch semantics are expressed as side effects and thus this code is legal :) But wanted to offer possibly a different view.",
