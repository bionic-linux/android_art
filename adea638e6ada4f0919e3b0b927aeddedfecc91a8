      "message": "Thanks for making this change!\n\nFor `boolean android.app.IActivityManager$Stub.onTransact(int, android.os.Parcel, android.os.Parcel, int)` which I was investigating in my doc, I only see 12 int spill slots. This made me realize that I didn\u0027t explain myself correctly. What I\u0027m looking for is to create a metric that shows what\u0027s the ratio of instructions in a method that are just spills.\n\nI\u0027m interested in what looking at the top spilling methods (methods whose code is mostly spills) would teach us. For instance, are there coding practices that lead to more spills? Are there improvements that we could make to ART?\n\nI\u0027m going to read art/compiler/optimizing/register_allocator.h and read up more on linear scan register allocation and get back to you with more questions please.",

      "message": "What I can do is print the number of ART instructions as a CSV column too. It is not a 1:1 ratio with assembly instructions but it can give you a hint as to which methods to take a look at. Would that be useful to you? If so, patchset 4 contains that extra column with the instructions.",

      "message": "Close but not quite. The column I\u0027m missing is the number of spill instructions. Looking more at the code I realize this may not be as simple, so I\u0027d settle for the count of times that we failed to allocate a free register for an instruction and had to spill some other register first (I hope I\u0027m making sense).\n\nAt this point I realize I\u0027ve already taken quite a bit of your time. So I must ask if this is interesting to you and whether you\u0027d like to continue, or if you\u0027d rather if I kept pushing on this on my own.",

      "message": "Maybe what you are looking for is related to ParallelMove instructions? I am not sure if I got what you meant.\n\nI\u0027m finishing my day here in the UK right now. I might have some time to take a look at this but I don\u0027t know how many free cycles I\u0027d have. If you are confident enough to pursue this on your own, it would free up my time. Feel free to reach out and I will help with what I can.\n\nWe will be interested in your results for sure",
