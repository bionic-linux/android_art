      "message": "@rpl @mast: ready for review again.\n\nIn theory, now it should be possible to define `libart` target by combining defaults from `libart-runtime` and `libart-compiler`. However, that requires referencing `srcs` from different subdirectory, which only works with `filegroup`. And `filegroup` doesn\u0027t work with `codegen` that we use in `libart-compiler`... \n\nI suggest leaving `libart-compiler.a` and `libart-runtime.a` static libs for now. I can clean that up once `codegen` is removed (probably in b/247785938)",
