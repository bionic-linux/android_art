      "message": "The reporter and the author concluded on the bug that this should be reverted. It doesn\u0027t break anything badly, but it\u0027s a late change with no demonstrable benefit that adds a bit of complexity. It\u0027s safer to just revert. The real fix appears to be significantly more involved, and probably completely different.",
