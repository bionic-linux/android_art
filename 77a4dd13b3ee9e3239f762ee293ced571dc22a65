The script works just fine for host (I built it earlier today with big manifest).\n\nAs for target, I had a CL here to fix it for big manifest: https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/292776/\n\nFWIW I\u0027m changing buildbot-build.sh and run-libcore-tests.sh script anyway to add support for javac/dx builds.",

I am happy to add this, I should know how to run (and modify) most of the tests by now. Can take a look at it at some point after I get back depending on urgency.\n\n\u003e Why does buildbot-build only work in the small manifest? That seems surprising.\n\nIt\u0027s just written to work so it only really supports building with armv8-eng and arm_krait-eng which I don\u0027t think exist in other manifests. The target build also depends on public.libraries.txt (incorrectly for other product types, see the previous CL). OTOH, public.libraries.txt is kind of irrelevant without a CUSTOM_TARGET_LINKER.\n\n....\n\nThat being said it\u0027s probably ok for now if you want to check this in, just change the build rules to call buildbot-build.sh. Target won\u0027t work for now because it needs extra changes in the script to work on a typical lunch target.",
