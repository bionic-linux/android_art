I think that would be easier then trying to fix bugs / deficiencies in the DWARF relocator.",

      "message": "I think this was done to not add another s***-load of patch locations. You could try to add the oat_patches entries, and let us know by how much it grows.\n\nI would want to point out that I don\u0027t think you are right with \"easier then trying to fix / bugs in the DWARF relocator.\" .oat_patches is our own custom thing, and as far as I remember, everything is 32-bit. To me it sounds like taking advantage of DWARF knowledge is better than trying to encode that into random patches.\n\nAnyways, feel free to clean this code up in a follow-up. This is mostly just a refactor to make it at least not horrible fail when trying to emit 64-bit ELF files.",
