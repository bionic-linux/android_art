      "message": "I already saw the use of sizeof to count the number of characters of a string elsewhere in ART. I suppose this is not working here because TOOL_PREFIX is a char* so sizeof would return 4 (or 8 on 64bit), right?\n\nStill I wonder if there is not a difference of 1 in the count. If TOOL_PREFIX was a char[], sizeof would return the number of characters + 1 for the \u0027\\0\u0027. Shouldn\u0027t we add 1 to strlen *or* was sizeof wrong from the start here?",
