      "message": "This change is OK as a follow-up to the previous CL. However, we should probably file a separate bug for properly updating the `JdkUnsafe` intrinsics in `UnstartedRuntime` and codegens.\n\nI would also prefer to deprecate the \"Android-added\" methods that have an equivalent method from upstream. (But we cannot actually remove them for as long as they are being used by platform code in supported releases.)",
