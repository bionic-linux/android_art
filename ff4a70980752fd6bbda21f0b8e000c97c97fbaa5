      "message": "Roland: I have said yesterday that I choose not use Uleb128 because of performance cost of accessing later fields.  However, I have realized there is easy way around that.  I could decode the whole header in CodeInfo constructor, and keep the data as fields of CodeInfo.  I do not think there is any difference in size to the current approach, it would potentially make the code clearer by using known hammer.",
