      "message": "We have a WaitForGcToComplete call in Runtime::~Runtime(). Was it not doing its job? If so, should we merge the two calls and remove the WaitForGcToComplete call in Runtime::~Runtime()?\n\nAlso, should we do this DisableGCForShutdown() WaitForGcToComplete() sequence in an earlier point in Runtime::~Runtime() rather than here, maybe around the time we call java_lang_Daemons_stop? It seems that by the time we get to this destructor, we have already started turning things down like the heap thread pool and it may be a bit too late, particularly if we expect that a GC may be in progress up to this point.",
