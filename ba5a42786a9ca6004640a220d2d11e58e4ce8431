      "message": "It was added in https://r.android.com/1649428 to support e.g. `atest --host libunwindstack_unit_test`. Can you please test that it still works with prebuilts where these are gone?\n\n(That test links `libdexfile_support` statically, but that in turn has a [runtime dependency](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:art/libdexfile/Android.bp;l\u003d442;drc\u003d56ab4a69151d4fc9308058a6ba8059ee49d8633f) on `libdexfile`, even on host. Maybe the right way to go there is to link it statically into `libdexfile_support` on host, but I don\u0027t remember if there was a reason why we didn\u0027t take that route back then.)",
