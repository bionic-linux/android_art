Can we somehow preclude that case?\n\nAlso since ScopedInterruptibleGCCriticalSection basically impersonates a GC, I don\u0027t see why that wouldn\u0027t give us license to call RunEmptyCheckpoint, as claimed around line 103.\n\nMaybe with your change, we don\u0027t need ScopedInterruptibleGCCriticalSection anymore?",
