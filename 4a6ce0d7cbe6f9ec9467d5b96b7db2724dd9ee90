      "message": "Ah thanks for pointing out `ScopedInterruptibleGCCriticalSection` impersonates a GC - I didn\u0027t realize it was. So you\u0027re right, the call to `RunEmptyCheckpoint` should be fine here (all that code precludes my changes).\n\nCan you elaborate on:\n\u003e If we suspend this from another thread, while we\u0027re locking out GC, and then the thread that suspended us allocates and needs a GC, we lose. Can we somehow preclude that case?\n\nWhat is `this` in `if we suspend this`? Is it this thread? If that\u0027s the case, shouldn\u0027t we fully remove`ScopedInterruptibleGCCriticalSection`.\n\n\u003e Maybe with your change, we don\u0027t need ScopedInterruptibleGCCriticalSection anymore?\n\nUnfortunately, we still need to prevent the GC to run while lines 115-116 are executed. Is there another way to do that?",
