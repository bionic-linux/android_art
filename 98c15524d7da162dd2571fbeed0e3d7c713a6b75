Those are enough to test both cases, including isolated loading? Do we need tests on the ART Service side as well?\n\n- The tests are [disabled](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:art/test/knownfailures.json;l\u003d305-324;drc\u003d25a1341f6ad06e6e6344c2a83e7632b0f9a628fa) in a number of configurations, but they still run in at least some configurations on LUCI.",
