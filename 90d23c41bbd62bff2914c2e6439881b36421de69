However, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m happy with the structure of the code now. I had to make some stuff in ReferenceTypePropagation public so that I can call the MergeTypes method from here passing in a handle cache.\n\nI\u0027m heading out on vacation for two weeks. If you have ideas on a better structure for this, let me know, and I\u0027ll get back to it in a couple of weeks. :)",
