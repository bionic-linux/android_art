It\u0027s for device after all, isn\u0027t it?\n\nTo do that I think you\u0027d have to add either \"libart\" or \"libart-broken\" in inheriting modules then (there are only two where it should be \"libart\", so I wouldn\u0027t bother with a new intermediate defaults module). Overall that looks overall like a cleaner structure to me.",
