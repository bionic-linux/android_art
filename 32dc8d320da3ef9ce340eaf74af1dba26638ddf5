      "message": "Done; I didn\u0027t go into details about the performance difference in the comment even though I can guess 2 contributing factors. The first is that ARM CPUs tend to have special forwarding for the common pattern CMP+B.cond while MNV+CBNZ is not likely to get that special treatment. The second may have to do with the MVN being a shited register instruction, limiting the ability to dual-issue.",
