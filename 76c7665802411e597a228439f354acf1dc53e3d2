      "message": "Hey I added all this code here for the non-rosalloc case, but does this loop even get taken for the concurrent collector?\n\nIt looks like allocation_stack_ is an ObjectStack (AtomicStack\u003cObject\u003e) and may have nothing to do with the thread_local_pos_offset that TLAB uses?\n\nThis is kind of a real question because it looks like current TLAB ASM will publish w/o ordering the class pointer store, I think the check for \"obj-\u003eGetClass !\u003d nullptr\" is absolutely necessary for TLAB.",
