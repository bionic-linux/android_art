If it is, how come we were not affected by it?\n\nNot sure what\u0027s happening here, but I did hit that test failure as a presubmit (https://android-build.googleplex.com/builds/tests/view?invocationId\u003dI82300006685940330\u0026redirect\u003dhttp%3A%2F%2Fsponge2%2F12a5dc94-6bdb-44f8-93ed-8863877e5c21\u0026testResultId\u003dTR16615448515601199) while working on another change (https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/art/+/1435791/4).\n\nWe did have a few CLs merged in `platform/art` between the moment b/173677667 and b/174260111 were filed (resp. 19 November and 25 November) and the moment https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/art/+/1513256/ was merged (today, 1 December), so I would have expected this test to be run as part of presubmits (and fail).\n\nI\u0027ll check with the Android EngProd team.",
