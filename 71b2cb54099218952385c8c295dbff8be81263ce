      "message": "We used to initialize the old field assume_profile_changed_ in the constructor.  But we don\u0027t initialize the new field profile_analysis_result_ in the constructor.  From my quick reading of the code, if looks like if the option `--profile-analysis-result\u003d` is not used in invoking the tool, then profile_analysis_result_ will be used uninitialized.\n\nI don\u0027t know if we\u0027re able to assure that command line option is always used, so this isn\u0027t really a concern.  But naively, it seems like we might want to initialize profile_analysis_result_ in the constructor, to assure consistent behavior if that command line option is not used.",
