      "message": "Please, have a look at the code above. I believe, without this fix we can experience crashes in rare circumstances. In particular, when invoking a helper with arguments w1, w0, the code below is generated,\n\n  mov w0, w1\n  mov w1, w0\n  # and helper is called.\n\nAFAICS, the problem is that (x.GetReg() \u003d\u003d y.GetReg()) is not a good way of checking whether two RegStorage-s are referring to the same underlying physical register.\n\nIn general, the function TargetReg() seems to need an update. Something like TargetReg(arg_num, arg_type, arg_size) would be good. Unfortunately, TargetReg is widely used in the quick compiler and, as far as I can see, it is responsible for a large number of instruction-misusage-check failures in the arm64 assembler.",
