      "message": "Hi,\n\nAs discussed previously, this is the CL that turns large object alignment back to the runtime page size on a page-agnostic build of ART, avoiding extra memory consumption on 4K systems.\n\nLet me know if you like the approach. The main thing here is that SpaceBitmap\u003c\u003e is still templated with a const value of kMinPageSize (4K). We accept that if the runtime page size is 16K, then only 1 out of every 4 bit will actually be in-use. It seems reasonable to keep things simpler, at the cost of a bit of memory.\n\nThanks,\nPierre",
