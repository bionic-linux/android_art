      "message": "hello,we had a trouble after megerd this feature.\nWe found that if we improve the priority of the target lock thread, there is a small probability that the ksoftirqd thread of the tasklet running the WiFi module will not be scheduled in time and eventually crash. Your company also has a boost operation on the surfaceflinger. I would like to ask if you had any relevant processing on the improvement of priority and the preemption of soft interrupt threads that cannot be scheduled in time\n",
