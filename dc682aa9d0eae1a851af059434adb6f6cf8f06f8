Adding a 4th character is unlikely to help nearly as much as doubling the size of the 2nd level.\n\nMaps, sheets, gmail have up to 6 bits of classdepth\u003d2. I\u0027ve seen Uber app run out on overflow at classdepth\u003d1 so adding an extra bit to first level will also help.\n\nThis is based on the bitstring data we collected earlier, I shared the spreadsheet with you.\n\n(This can be changed in a follow up if you just want to submit now)",
