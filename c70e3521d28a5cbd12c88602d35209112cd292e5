      "message": "\u003e Patch Set 12:\n\u003e \n\u003e Artem, you mentioned that this CL should be submitted together with the two follow-op CLs (as one topic). However, they are not in a topic now. Gerrit shows them as stacked because they are related, and if you click k-th CL in the stack then you see CLs up to (k-1)-th as \"submitted together\". But they don\u0027t have a topic and can all be submitted individually one after another. Do you have any concerns if I submit them one by one?\n\nThe idea of having everything submitted in one go was related to the fact that only CL #3 makes all the tests fully pass with CHECKER (with CHECKER off individual CLs pass the tests) for the SVE case. Non-sve case pass all the tests as well of course. But as SVE is turned off by default, nothing will be actually broken if the CLs are merged separately.",
