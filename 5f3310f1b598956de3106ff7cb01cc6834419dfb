Not sure if there is a better way.\n\nChange summary from PS1/original:\n\nBesides the build error, I found two issues on TH (not sure why it didn\u0027t trigger before).\n\n1. odrefresh/art_odrefresh_tests.xml: odrefresh now starts to depend on a library in CompOS, so we need to manually add to LD_LIBRARY_PATH to make art_standalone_odrefresh_tests run.\n\n2. master-art branch is failing since CompOS isn\u0027t in the repo manifests.  ag/16041255 should fix it, but I need to see if we can avoid a dirty workaround in that change.",
