They\u0027d then be changed back at the same time we submit prebuilts with prefer:true.\n\nFrom that point on, any build that doesn\u0027t use any of the ART-specific product targets in https://r.android.com/1513781 will be forced to use the prebuilts, and building ART from sources will only work in manifests where the prebuilts aren\u0027t present, i.e. on master-art but not AOSP/internal master.\n\nRoland, how will this affect testing? Do we depend on sources in platform branches for CI?",
