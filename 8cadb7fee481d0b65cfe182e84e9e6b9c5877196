I suggest this (provided I understand the problem correctly):\n\n    // Only include native libraries in this test APEX. The intention\n    // was to not include binaries (and maybe other artifacts) for now,\n    // as they\u0027d pull the \"non-broken\" `libart` module into this test\n    // APEX and overwrite `libart-broken`. However, with\n    // unwanted_transitive_deps we can ensure `libart` gets excluded\n    // anyway.\n    // TODO(mast): Add back the binaries and clean this up.",
