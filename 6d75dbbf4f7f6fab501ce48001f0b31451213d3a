      "message": "AFAIK, the `test_suite` property is just about packaging a test; it does not says when/where/how it is run.\n\nAIUI, tests in `general-tests` (and `device-tests`) are eligible to run in two ways:\n- automated, via Test Mapping (pre- and post-submit);\n- manually, via Atest.\n\nMoving tests from `general-tests` to `device-tests` does not really change how tests are built or run, but rather which build artifacts of these tests will be used. My understanding is that when a test is built as part of `general-tests`, it will be shared by several product build targets, which makes its easier to have a testing model where tests and products are loosely related (i.e. from different builds or even branches) â€“ I\u0027m not sure how formal the use cases are here. Moving to `device-tests` seems to give a hint that there\u0027s a tighter coupling between tests and products.\n\nAdding Dan and Julien to comment on my interpretation. ðŸ™‚",
