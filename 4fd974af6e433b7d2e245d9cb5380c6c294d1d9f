You can try the rebase option on the right and choose ``Rebase on top of the main branch (breaks relation chain)``. I am happy to give it a go and see if there are any merge conflicts if rebase doesn\u0027t work for you.\n\nI am not sure we need a base patch. When I have a relation chain and want to submit the patches individually, I rebase the one (usually the lowest on the chain) I want to submit on the main branch, submit it and then rebase the relation chain on top of main branch which would include the patches we already submitted (basically the base patch you have now). I am fine having a base patch too, whatever is easier for you.",
