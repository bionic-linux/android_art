Stack maps are always ordered by native PCs, except for methods with try/catch when you have normal stack maps first, followed by catch-point stack maps also ordered by native PCs (i think).\n\nWhat this means is:\n(a) You don\u0027t need to do a generic sort - you could simply find the start of the second list and scan two lists linearly.\n\n(b) There may be both a normal and a catch stack map for a given native PC. You\u0027re using a stable sort so you\u0027ll never confuse the two. Good, but please explain why you need that.",
