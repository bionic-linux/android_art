      "message": "I\u0027m not sure this is correct in general, as the linker configuration file located in the ART APEX is supposed to be used only by binaries in the ART APEX; we should actually generate a new linker configuration file under `/linkerconfig` in the chroot dir for \"platform\" binaries (see Bug 147737840).\n\nThis is fine with me as a temporary measure if it unblocks ART\u0027s continuous testing; could you add a TODO here to remind us to fix this?",

      "message": "Yes â€“ The platform linker configuration (which used to be in `/system/etc/ld.*.txt`, and is now in `/linkerconfig/ld.config.txt`) is the default linker configuration. But if the linker finds a binary located under `/apex/\u003cmodule\u003e/bin`, it will first try to pick `/apex/\u003cmodule\u003e/etc/ld.config.txt` as linker configuration.\n\nIn the case of ART, the former is used by the shell, toybox binaries, etc.",
