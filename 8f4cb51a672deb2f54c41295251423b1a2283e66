      "message": "Just a quick comment on this even though I did not review rest of patch. It appears here you are renaming uses. I am guessing likely you are doing this because you are maintaining ssa. However, if you are renaming any VRs, my request is that you make it possible that if someone wants to run the post-opts after your pass, it is still possible. Namely, whatever ssa you maintain could also be regenerated if need be (however, I do agree that maintaining has lower overhead than doing post-opts, which is why I am okay with this approach).",
