      "message": "sorry to come back to this. \n\nThere are some CLs which fix the SELinux policy for profiler files. The files are created by installd and their permission is update to restrict access just to the system server and the app (https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/97674/2). I fear that creating the file like this will actually leak details. I\u0027ll check with nnk@ as there are some details regarding permissions that I\u0027m no fully familiar with.\n\nAs a side note:\nI\u0027m thinking that it might be cleaner and easier actually to update the original format and store the dex_pc in the current profile file. The disadvantage is that we\u0027ll take more space but I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll have so many different PC per functions to worry about it. One way to compact this is: \"method/total_count/size/[pc_1:count_1,pc_2:count_2...]\"",
