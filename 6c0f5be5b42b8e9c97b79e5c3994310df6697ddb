      "message": "Is there a benefit to doing this versus an arena vector? We have to do a `auto* vregs \u003d reinterpret_cast\u003cHUserRecord\u003cHEnvironment*\u003e*\u003e(this + 1);` below and it is less intuitive than having a `vregs_` field.\nI\u0027d think that two allocations (one for `HEnvironment`, and the other for the `vregs`) should result in the same code. The only difference is that they wouldn\u0027t be guaranteed to be contiguous but that should be fine I\u0027d think.",
