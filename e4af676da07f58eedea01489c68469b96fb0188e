      "message": "This is broken (my fault - it was also previously broken).  A recent revision of the RegStorage encoding which moved the FP bit failed to update this code.  A core register should set a corresponding bit in 0..31, while a fp reg should set in 32..63.  Before the RegStorage encoding update, this code achieved that.  Now, we\u0027ll need something like what\u0027s done in x86\u0027s GetRegMaskCommon().",
