      "message": "The TH failures show that the transitive dependency on libasync_safe breaks, because of the delayed linking of static libraries.\n\nI\u0027d rather not put back libasync_safe as whole_static_libs in libsigchain, because the prebuilt drops will reexport all of the Bionic headers then. Instead, can you please try making a libsichain_static alternative of libsigchain which has the requisite whole_static_libs:[\"libasync_safe\"] and then use that here?",
