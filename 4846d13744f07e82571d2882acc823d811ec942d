      "message": "Why did you remove the call to tryInlineFloat() (as well as the ones to returnVoid() and returnVoidWithOneParameter()) from test/437-checker-inliner/src/Main.java from PS5?  Was it because these are already assessed by test/437-inline/src/Main.java?  Or maybe because there\u0027s no Checker-style annotation for those?",

      "message": "I initially put them there to replicate 437-inline so it could be fully replaced by this test. At the meeting Nicola said he\u0027d prefer to leave 437 in place and have a separate test focused just on Checker, even if it means some duplicity. \n\nThe tryInlineFloat is a regression test for a specific bug which has nothing to do with Checker. Hence, I removed it from here and it will remain in 437.\n\nreturnVoid and returnVoidWithParameter are both called from InlineVoid. I changed it to call the Invoke* methods over return* to test that the methods verified by Checker also run as expected rather than inlining them differently in a large main() method.",
