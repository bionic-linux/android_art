      "message": "One thing to discuss, talking to Ruben, we were wondering if you liked having a dedicated variable for large object alignments. Otherwise this CL turns it back into `gPageSize`.\n\nWould you prefer to have a `gLargeObjectAlignment` variable? I was thinking that if such a variable was always going to be the same as `gPageSize`, it might be better not to make a distinction. Given a configuration where `gPageSize !\u003d gLargeObjectAlignment` would not be tested, I would expect over time we may end up with inconsistent use of either, which may not be an issue really.\n\nWDYT?",
