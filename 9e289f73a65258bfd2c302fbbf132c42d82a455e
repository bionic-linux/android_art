      "message": "I am not sure if they were actually ever used. We used to pass dex_pc and this_object to the listeners but none of the listeners used them. I did look at past history but I couldn\u0027t find when they were used. There are three listeners for method entry / exit events:\n\nJVMTI: the support was added in 2017 and we didn\u0027t use these there as well (CL: https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/art/+/384352)\ntrace.cc: They existed much longer goes back to 2013, but I couldn\u0027t find any use.\ntracefast: I think these events are just a nop there. This is just for testing I think. Added here: https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/art/+/691227\n\nSince trace.cc existed longest, I suppose they were added there and other listeners had implemented there too. I am not sure why they were added.",
