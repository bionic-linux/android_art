If you need to test on such devices, you\u0027ll need to carry your own patches.\n\nNote that the code you\u0027re rewriting has a bug. These `shNadd` instructions have been replaced by `shNadd.uw` in https://android-review.googlesource.com/2796182 . So you would need 3 instructions here (SLLI+SRLI+ADD), otherwise `new-array` with a negative number of elements could succeed.",
