Is this what was mentioned the other day, where you try to achieve atomicity?\n\nUnless other code accessing the target memory also use load/store exclusive, I don\u0027t think the \u0027exclusive\u0027 brings anything.\n\nIs what you want to know whether the LDRD is loads the 64 bits atomically? In this case have a look at `ArmInstructionSetFeatures::has_atomic_ldrd_strd_`.",
