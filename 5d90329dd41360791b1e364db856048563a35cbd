      "message": "This is overly pessimistic for small types and off-by-one for long/double (the branch should be JAE instead of JA). The same off-by-one error is in other `COMPUTE_ARRAY_SIZE_*` macros.\n\nI think this check should be done in the `ALLOC_ARRAY_TLAB_FAST_PATH_RESOLVED_WITH_SIZE` as on arm64. In that macro, we finish the exact size calculation (with the ANDQ instruction) and we can do a precise check (the threshold is aligned, so we could compare even before the ANDQ). This would also reduce the amount of almost indentical code across the `COMPUTE_ARRAY_SIZE_*` macros.",

      "message": "I see we have the same off-by-one error on x86 and we cannot easily move the check to `ALLOC_ARRAY_TLAB_FAST_PATH_RESOLVED_WITH_SIZE` there. So we should really fix JA to JAE for x86 and we may want to think whether to replace the imprecise check in the `COMPUTE_ARRAY_SIZE_UNKNOWN` with two checks to make it precise; first the same check as in `COMPUTE_ARRAY_SIZE_8` which would avoid overflows in the size calculation, and then a precise check after calculating the size.",
