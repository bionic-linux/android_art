      "message": "David, can you take another look. I made more changes that I think should be okay, but want to get your feedback. My one worry is that the offsets in the dynamic symbols do not match the symtab. But I think the old code assumed those were the same too, so I don\u0027t think the new code is out of line.\n\nThanks.",
