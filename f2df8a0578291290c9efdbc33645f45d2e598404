      "message": "I have indeed tried that: in theory, I don\u0027t see any (obvious) reasons why that would not work, but in practice it doesn\u0027t - I can see around a hundred errors for each line in `jvmti.h` and 16 for each line in `jvm.h` where the `typedef` statement is used.\n\nAn alternative solution (which I have already verified would be good for clang-tidy as well) would be to modify the two headers file to have the `// NOLINTBEGIN` and `// NOLINTEND` comments there - although I am not totally sold on the idea because:\n1. both files are external (in fact, both coming from Oracle) and I wonder whether there could be updates to these files in the future that would cause a merge conflict because of this change;\n2. the jvmti.h header file has an explicit `/* AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT */` comment which I would be inclined to respect.\n\nDo you see any other solutions I\u0027m not seeing?",
