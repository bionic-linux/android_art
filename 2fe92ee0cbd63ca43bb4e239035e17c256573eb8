      "message": "Certainly there can be concurrent allocations. And all allocations get tracked as we intercept into every tlab allocation (in heap-inl.h).\nFor accuracy I should change this store to a compare_exchange, but I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s necessary. This happens only once per GC cycle. Eventually the value of last_reported_heap_size_ would converge due to the change in heap-inl.h\n\nPlease let me know if changing this to compaer_exchange is warranted. I\u0027ll upload another patch then.",
