      "message": "I think that contra-intuitively - small input dex should make the fuzzer more efficient and find more cases - it allows to do many more iterations per second.  So the smaller, the better.\n\nOne \"HelloWorld\" dex should keep you entertained with fuzzer bugs for quite a while.\n\nThen once the fuzzer passes, we can see if we can find another small examples from run-tests to make it find further corner cases.\n\nAnd only then I would start looking at real-world huge dex file (and even then I would try to use to identify how to create further minimal dex smaples rather than committing them)",

If say \"ADD\" opcode causes a crash, we should probably only add the smallest dex that we can find that does \"ADD\".  No need to add 10MB dex files, right?",
