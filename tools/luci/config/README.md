## Configurations files for art LUCI builders.

This directory contains art's configs for its LUCI builders.

They are generated by the [lucicfg] tool based on Starlark code.
See [main.star] for configs of production builders.

After modifying any of the files, run `./main.star` to regenerate the configs.
Presubmit checks will also remind you to do so.
