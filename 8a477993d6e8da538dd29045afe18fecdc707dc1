      "message": "I had a vague idea that we could be sloppy about switching JNI on and off. Presumably that\u0027s not a common or very useful case? Could we make this work if we just dropped the free list at a switch to CheckJni? We would presumably get the memory back when we pop the stack, so this isn\u0027t a long term leak. And does anybody do this with an appreciable LRT size outside of tests?",
