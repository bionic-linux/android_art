With cherry-pick ag/12344428 it works: https://android-build.googleplex.com/builds/forrest/run/L69600000661731949\n\nNot sure what is happening here. Maybe the problem is that the two changes in this topic (aosp/1396609 and aosp/1396647) are in two different branches (resp. `aosp/master` and `aosp/master-art`). Do we know whether this case is supported?\n\n\u003e I don\u0027t recall seeing this kind of failure with topics including manifest changes before. Is there something wrong with the setup of git_master-art? Roland, I presume you set it up?\n\nThere is a merge path between `aosp/master-art` and `goog/master-art` (via `goog/mirror-aosp-master-art`) for all projects on the `aosp/master-art` manifest – including the manifest itself – (see b/139131024), except for projects which are not part of the `aosp/master` manifest, like `prebuilts/runtime` (see b/154601724).\n\n\u003e Also, is there a merge path between git_master-art and git_master-art-host for platform/manifest?\n\nNo.",

Looks like master-art as a branch only exists for the manifest: https://r.android.com/q/branch:master-art\n\n\u003e No.\n\nOk, then I\u0027ll need a cherry-pick for master-art-host but not git_master-art, as usual.",
