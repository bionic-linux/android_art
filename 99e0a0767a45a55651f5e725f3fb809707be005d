      "message": "I think the TH failures on git_master-art are false alarms - it looks like they ran without the corresponding manifest change. With cherry-pick ag/12344428 it works: https://android-build.googleplex.com/builds/forrest/run/L69600000661731949\n\nI don\u0027t recall seeing this kind of failure with topics including manifest changes before. Is there something wrong with the setup of git_master-art? Roland, I presume you set it up?\n\nAlso, is there a merge path between git_master-art and git_master-art-host for platform/manifest?",
