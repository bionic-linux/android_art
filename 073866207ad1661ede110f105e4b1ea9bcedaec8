      "message": "I don\u0027t understand this comment.\n\nMy understanding of what the function does is this: given a dex location and the path of a dalvik cache directory, return the path to what the oat file should be named. This is done by turning the dex location into a file name (replacing \u0027/\u0027 with \u0027@\u0027 to get a valid filename), and adding \u0027@classes.dex\u0027. Does it do something different for the boot image?\n\nAfter thinking some more, there is an ambiguity about what should happen if the dex location isn\u0027t absolute. Two sensible options are:\n 1. Turn a relative dex location into an absolute dex location and form the oat file name from that.\n 2. Treat a relative dex location as a separate dex location from the dex location corresponding to the absolute path of the relative dex location.\n\nI had only thought of (2), not (1) when I posted this change. It seems a shame to add the work and complexity of (1) given that nobody uses relative dex locations. I\u0027ll have to think more about what I want to do here.\n\nThoughts?",
