      "message": "We can expand the check to all classes but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s needed.\n\nWe should not be able to verify a class if any of its dependencies is unverified. So it should not be necessary to look at anything else beside the classes marked as verified. If the app redefines a class but that cannot be verified than all its dependents will be unverified which is the behaviour that we want.\n\nAm I missing a case here?",
