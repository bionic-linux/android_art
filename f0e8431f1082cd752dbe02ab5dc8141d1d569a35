      "message": "We can expand the check to all classes but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s needed.\n\nWe should not be able to verify a class if any of its dependencies is unverified. So it should not be necessary to look at anything else beside the classes marked as verified. If the app redefines a class but that cannot be verified than all its dependents will be unverified which is the behaviour that we want.\n\nAm I missing a case here?",

      "message": "Agree with Nicolas. A class does not need to be verified to be used as a dependent in verification. All we need is resolution/linking (and even that is somewhat an optimization we do).\n\nThe argument behind that is that if a dependent later fails verification, you are unable to provide an instance (for instance methods/fields) or pass static initialization (for class accessors) to run through the current class (and null is always legal as an instance, even for failed classes).",
