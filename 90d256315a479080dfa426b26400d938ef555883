Except for one small wrinkle I can\u0027t find any observable effects (it\u0027s e.g. clear that `mRunningJob !\u003d null` is no longer synchronised with JobScheduler\u0027s idea of whether a job is running, but it doesn\u0027t seem to matter). However that doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m convinced there aren\u0027t any.",

It would be nice with a `Utils.check(!mIsRunningJobKnownByJobScheduler)` before this to make it clear that the `if` statement there dtrt, but that\u0027s contingent on having a test for this code branch. Do we have that? (Btw pinged b/321241566 about the broken coverage annotations.)",
