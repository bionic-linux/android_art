So we\u0027re defining a static library, but we access the headers of said library not be library dependencies, but by the fact that they\u0027re in the dex2oat directory. Not very well modularized/isolated.\n\n(I was actively trying to kill these things, so it becomes obvious when one library depends on another in a way that it shouldn\u0027t - e.g., see the intrinsics, where libart uses libart-compiler.)",
