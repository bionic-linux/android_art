      "message": "I think that `host` may have various meanings here. Are you trying to run tests on top of libcore or OpenJDK ?\n\nI think that `host_supported: true` here means running on top of OpenJDK, and it should be possible by using a different sdk_version for the host target. If the goal is to run on top of libcore and ART on a Linux box, I suspect that it may already be supported if LUCI host targets are not broken.",
