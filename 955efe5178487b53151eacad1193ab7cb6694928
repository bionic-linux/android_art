      "message": "It looks like because of http://ag/13699210 (adding dex2oat metric ids and metadata), we are going to have to wait until the cherry pick to AOSP lands (https://r.android.com/1612689) and then do a prebuilts update.\n\nThe problem is that because http://ag/13699210 added an extra field to ArtDatumReported, the generated stats_write function takes an extra argument when being build against source than when being built against prebuilts.\n\nThis is probably going to cause issues for us again in the future.",

      "message": "I sent out a ping.\n\nGoing forward, I think the process to update the proto will be:\n\n1. Change atoms.proto in AOSP\n2. Update ART prebuilts from AOSP (after build completes)\n3. Wait for automerger to merge into internal branches.\n4. Update ART code to use new atoms.proto changes.\n\nThat\u0027s probably doable, we\u0027ll just have to be careful.\n\nIf we add a new Atom, we\u0027ll want to do that on Internal first, so we make sure not to conflict with any of the other atom IDs.",
