      "message": "I like this version much better, but I wonder whether a fixed constant, independent of heap size, is appropriate here. I would have suggested something like \"if you\u0027re less than 25% of the way toward target_footprint_ skip the GC here.\" With a fixed amount here, we risk inflating the size of otherwise small background processes. My intuition is that we should do this only when it costs us a small percentage of the process\u0027 memory.\n\nWe should also probably avoid returning here if IsLowMemoryMode()?",
