      "message": "An alternative might be to ignore SetLogger calls if we\u0027ve picked the file logger. But I don\u0027t really like that either - ignoring a clear request will cause confusion, and it would be fine to use e.g. a stdout logger.",

      "message": "AFAIK, the motivation of the explicit logging initialization is to force write the log to logd even if partners has changed the default logger (b/201042799). Setting \"ro.log.file_logger.path\" is one of the ways that a partner may use to change the default logger, so we do want to override that.\n\nTo solve the logging problem in Microdroid, one way I can see is to call InitLogging only if it\u0027s Android. This means we need dynamically determine if it\u0027s Android or Microdroid. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the best approach to achieve this. Maybe you can try checking some sysprops that only exists on Android, such as `ro.build.version.sdk`?",
