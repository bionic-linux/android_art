      "message": "I don\u0027t fully understand what visibility we\u0027re trying to ensure here. Are we trying to ensure that the updated roots_data is visible to any threads that see the updated code_ptr? Or more than that?\n\nThat would normally just require fences (DMBs) or acquire/release operations, not a cache flush. It\u0027s not immediately clear to me why a cache flush on non-code is helpful. Cache flushes are normally only needed to reestablish consistency between I and D caches (or in some other situations that don\u0027t apply to user-level code on current hardware).\n\nIs the problem that we can\u0027t put a fence (or acquire) on the reader side, and hence need to fake it in a one-sided manner? Are we really trying to emulate the linux membarrier() system call here, which we don\u0027t have on current systems?",
