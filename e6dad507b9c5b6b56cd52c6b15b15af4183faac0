True they may build, but do the results work interchangeably? +rpl for input.\n\nOne thing is that there\u0027s no corresponding x86_64 lunch target for master-art. That\u0027s a deficiency which is somewhat annoying because it\u0027s the most common Cuttlefish target, at least for me, and actually a reason I frequently choose to not use master-art.\n\n(We also have a wish to get rid of the oddball ART targets in `device/generic/art` and instead make the ordinary ones work for master-art, but that\u0027s another subject.)",
