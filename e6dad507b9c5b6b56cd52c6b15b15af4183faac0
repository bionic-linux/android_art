      "message": "Thanks for the effort, but I\u0027m not sure about this. True they may build, but do the results work interchangeably? +rpl for input.\n\nOne thing is that there\u0027s no corresponding x86_64 lunch target for master-art. That\u0027s a deficiency which is somewhat annoying because it\u0027s the most common Cuttlefish target, at least for me, and actually a reason I frequently choose to not use master-art.\n\n(We also have a wish to get rid of the oddball ART targets in `device/generic/art` and instead make the ordinary ones work for master-art, but that\u0027s another subject.)",

      "message": "The `armv8` one works fine for me at least. Actually I never tried the `aosp_*` targets for ART development. I think the instructions I found before enabling the chroot were using the ART targets.\n\nMaybe we can change `silvermont` to also be a 64-bit target, similar to `arm_v7_v8`? It looks like Silvermont was also a 64-bit uarch, so this would be technically accurate.",

      "message": "\u003e I guess another alternative is use the aosp_x86_64 target on master-art.\n\nWell, builds on master-art are in effect unbundled, so full platform targets like aosp_\u003carch\u003e aren\u0027t really supposed to work there. However, the module_\u003carch\u003e targets ought to, and so this file ought to instruct the user to use those regardless of manifest. Last I tried there was something that failed on master-art with them, and I have an old ticket about it (b/179900989). I don\u0027t remember what the problem was, and I haven\u0027t tried in a long while, so it\u0027s possible they actually work now.\n\nThat\u0027d be lovely, and you\u0027re more than welcome to see if it does and update these instructions accordingly, but I have a feeling that may be a bit more than you were bargaining for here. ðŸ˜œ",
