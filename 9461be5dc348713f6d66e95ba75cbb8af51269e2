The recommended one seems to be apache csv: http://commons.apache.org/csv/\n\nIf you\u0027re feeling super keen, we could import this into the AOSP tree (there\u0027s a process for doing do, I\u0027ve done it once before but forget the details; see external/apache-commons-bcel in the tree).\n\nThis is probably ok for now though - if it copes with newlines in the text.",
