      "message": "(We\u0027re making an assumption here that `apex --otachroot-bootstrap` always adds mounts under /apex, or at least that the work we care about happens there. That seems fair enough. I was contemplating doing the same check at setup too, partially for the sake of symmetry, but otoh we should be able to trust the return status from apexd there.)\n\nSomewhat related, I again wondered why we bother calling apexd at all at teardown. It\u0027d be nice to have a comment here explaining that.\n\nAlso, small nit, I think it\u0027s a little more natural to do this check before the `FileExists` one.",
