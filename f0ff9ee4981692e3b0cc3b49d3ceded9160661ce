      "message": "I just realised that we have a bigger problem here.\n\nIf we update the build, the the dex files generated will have stricter API flags that currently. Mainline will then ship those dex files to devices running Q and R (where we don\u0027t have, and cannot have, the updated runtime). This will lead to severe app compat issues.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to proceed from here. I don\u0027t think we can make the build modularization changes we need without breaking Q and R devices (the runtime changes are ok though). Unless I\u0027m missing something? (I really hope I am!)",
