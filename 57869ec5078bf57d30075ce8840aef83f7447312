      "message": "This test gets a Blueprint file because it is supported at build time¹.\n\nIt is not added to ART\u0027s `TEST_MAPPING` because it is (currently) not yet supported at run time (because it has a custom `run` script). For the same reason:\n- it uses the `art-run-test-target-no-test-suite-tag-template` test configuration, which prevents it from being run in ART\u0027s non-`TEST_MAPPING` ATP configurations;\n- it\u0027s not added to ART MTS.\n\nNotes:\n¹I have made the choice of building ART run-tests even if we can\u0027t run them (yet) because:\n- it may help track any regression in building these tests;\n- I think this is useful when experimenting / trying to support these tests at run time.",
