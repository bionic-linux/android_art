If you can contain this to the test then it\u0027d be easier to review.\n\nIf the problem is to keep https://r.android.com/2981551 from merging into main and other downstream branches, I don\u0027t see a problem with avoiding that with the same Merged-In as in this CL.",

      "message": "I tried to make one commit for test update only, but found out that we need most of changes from this topic anyway, because test relies on logic to find and load library list files (such as vndksp_libraries_vendor) from the same source code where test is built, rather than source code for device image.  I can make one commit, but it would just look like squash of changes from this topic. WDYT?",

      "message": "It\u0027s not the number of CLs that makes me apprehensive, but that they change the non-test code. We\u0027re effectively backporting VIC changes to UDC here. Granted it\u0027s in a test-only branch, but I\u0027m unsure if confusion may arise from it still.\n\nI\u0027ve been looking into why libnativeloader is statically linked into this test, and I think it\u0027s wrong (b/327407752, discussion on https://r.android.com/2570071). My current plan is to take the test out of CTS (on main), and possibly introduce a subset of it into CTS again, but then making sure that it links libnativeloader dynamically and only calls the exported stable APIs in the map.txt file.\n\nIn either case that means the tests depending on public_libraries.cpp will disappear from CTS. I\u0027d like to hear your thoughts on that, i.e. if these tests are useful in CTS, and what exactly they should test in that case (since it\u0027s not testing libnativeloader.so).\n\nIf you agree it\u0027s correct to take them out of CTS then I\u0027d suggest doing that here too, i.e. add them to cts/tools/cts-tradefed/res/config/cts-known-failures.xml.",
