      "message": "The patch is trying to find a candidate which is a part of a dependency chain and is more likely having other instructions depending on it. \u0027HasMoreLikeDependencies\u0027 is a heuristic to select a candidate. Without this, we would have to check if there is a way from \u0027other\u0027 to \u0027instruction\u0027 in the dependency graph. It\u0027s time-consuming.\n\nWhat if we change this to \u0027dep_chain_candidate\u0027 to make it self-documented? What if we keep two candidates instead of one? Will it help to detect more redundant edges?",
