      "message": "Igor and I had a chat on this. But currently it seems that the Set() call somehow changed the collector type from CMS to None, which was being passed into the Heap constructor, which was causing the crash. If you revert this change and pass in \"-Xgc:CMS\" (or any valid collector type) on the command line, you\u0027d see the crash.",
