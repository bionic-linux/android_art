      "message": "I am worried that we may not be fully utilizing this MADV_FREE. If you look at `AllocateRegion()`, we look for first free region from the beginning. The chosen region may have been freed prior to previous GC cycle, while there are regions, later in the order, which were freed in the last GC cycle. This means we\u0027d be doing FIFO type usage whereas `MADV_FREE` is best suited for LIFO type usage.\n\nIf this is happening then we are not only taking the sub-optimal path of releasing the pages (via kswapd), we are also doubling the memset overhead.",
