      "message": "The native code was giving back fake results so as to pass even in configurations where the test is meaningless. I\u0027ve cleaned up the native code (as I changed from assertX to isX), and I think it\u0027s better to just disable this part of the test in meaningless situations.\n\n(Note that black-listing isn\u0027t right because you still want to test interpreter mode, for example. And yes, I strongly believe these tests belong in this run-test. If you disagree, a follow-up could split this out.)",
