If this issue were to happen, we would spot it quickly, as the run-time would not even start.\n\nThe proposed fix is in the follow-up CL (https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/art/+/737437), but I thought it made sense to have one CL expose the (theoretical) issue and another (attempt to) fix it.",
