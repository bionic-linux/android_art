      "message": "That is a good idea. I tried this in patchset#3, and I think it works great on regular builds.\n\nBut I think this might run into issues in dist builds because we dist `gtest_output` in line 207. So we might run into issues like such after we run installclean\n```\n$ m dist test-art-host-gtest-art_libdexfile_external_tests32\nFAILED: ninja: \u0027out/host/linux-x86/obj/PACKAGING/art-host-gtest_intermediates/art_libdexfile_external_tests32.xml\u0027, needed by \u0027out/dist/gtest/art_libdexfile_external_tests32\u0027, missing and no known rule to make it\n\n```\n\nI have updated the CL to the previous implementation.",
