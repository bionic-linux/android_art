You\u0027re right then it\u0027s not just heap poisoning, looks like it\u0027s walleye specific.\n\nI\u0027m hesitant in filing a bug that I don\u0027t think is worth investigating. The test has been written for Q, and there as been issues already around kernel versions. I\u0027ll mark that in the description.",
