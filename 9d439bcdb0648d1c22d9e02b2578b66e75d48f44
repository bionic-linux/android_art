There may just as well be an incompatible change in libbase.so at any moment and then probably all the gtests will break, so as a stopgap this is more predictable.\n\nI filed b/248485109 about this issue, but it probably won\u0027t help us with T-on-{S,T} tests, of course.",

      "message": "IIUC, this means most of our gtests will be moved to the \"eng-only\" MTS test plan and therefore will no longer be executed as part of the \"user\" MTS test plan, which is run by Android Partners (against devices running a \"user\" build) as part of Mainline Train Testing. Going ahead with this change as-is seems like a sudden regression in terms of test coverage.\n\nShould we discuss this a bit more before landing this change?",
