      "message": "Hi Ulyana,\nThanks again for landing this VIXL simulator CL, I\u0027m sure it will show its value for future ART compiler development.\n\nWith the latest change, one small problem I found is that the libartd-simulator.so is not generated by those build commands anymore.\nThe libartd-simulator.so could be generated by building host gtests, but in my enviroment this approach only works with full tree and doesn\u0027t work with master-art tree.\n\nPlease let me know how you build and generate libartd-simulator.so (on master-art tree would be great); this README needs to be updated accordingly.\n\nThanks\nXueliang",
