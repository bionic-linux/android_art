      "message": "This isn\u0027t as lightweight as we might believe. I\u0027m currently working in a full AOSP tree and I get two problems:\n\n1. It causes Soong to regenerate build.ninja and rerun kati every time in consecutive buildbot-build.sh runs, which takes over a minute. It happens both for --host and --target. It\u0027s probably a bug in the Soong invalidation of build.ninja, but this makes it get in the way much more.\n\n2. It deletes the system images which takes about half a minute to rebuild from intermediates, so if the same out tree is used for a platform build it gets annoying.",
