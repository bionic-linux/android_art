Why is that? (Not that it matters much for host tools, just curious.)",

      "message": "I think it made sense to include `oatdump` to the prebuilts, as the Oat file format is not fixed / standardized. If you want to inspect an Oat file, you usually need a version of `oatdump` compatible with it (i.e. built around the same time as the version of `dex2oat` that produced the Oat file. Providing `oatdump` as a prebuilt makes this more convenient (especially for third parties), as it does not require to identify the correct source revision of the ART Module and building `oatdump` from them.",
