      "message": "No, as we still use the SS collector in ART (see art::gc::Heap::PreZygoteFork and art::gc::ZygoteCompactingCollector).\n\nI think we used to use SS for gcstress configurations because this was best for stressing garbage collection, as it was the only moving collector in the old days. Now that CC is the default collector *and* and it is a moving collector, it seems logical to have gcstress configurations use it.",

All in all it seems like it\u0027s testing the same thing except with strictly less checking done.",
