Therefore, if we pass an instance of the old `BatchDexoptParams` class to this function, which expects a new jar, we\u0027ll get a crash.

      "message": "Interesting. Iiuc we can safely use any ADT in the BCP, like `java.util.List`, `java.util.Map`, and so on, right? So full serialisation to/from a byte array is in some sense overkill. However, I\u0027m not aware of any good tools to support structured data in the JDK, and I\u0027m not suggesting replacing this with a tangle of maps and lists.\n\nI guess one option in theory could be to put a data carrier class in the BCP, e.g. somewhere in libcore/dalvik/src/main/java/dalvik/. It wouldn\u0027t need to be a system API, and it would avoid the de/serialisation overhead. But it\u0027d be dislocated from the rest of the code, and there could be issues if we enable hiddenapi runtime enforcement of core platform APIs (which I plan to do), so it has drawbacks too.\n\nOtoh this serialisation may not be entirely negligible on low memory devices. The proto could get somewhat large, perhaps on the order of a MB, and it needs to be serialised into a single continuous memory area. It still feels like premature optimisation to design for that, so I\u0027ll just put the thought out there.\n\nBtw, just out of curiosity, do you know more exactly how it crashes when the same class is present in both class loaders? I figure the object would point to the class instance, so that\u0027d presumably be carried over with the vtable etc. Is it that the class instance doesn\u0027t point back to the data structures for the loaded dex files?",

The proto could get somewhat large, perhaps on the order of a MB, and it needs to be serialised into a single continuous memory area.\n\n1. The proto is a representation of `BatchDexoptParams`. If a device can\u0027t afford the proto, then it won\u0027t be able to afford the `BatchDexoptParams` object already. Moreover, the memory required for Pre-reboot Dexopt is orders of magnitude larger than this, so it wouldn\u0027t work anyway.\n2. I don\u0027t think the size of the proto will be in the order of a MB. The largest part in the proto is the list of packages. Let\u0027s say each package has 100 characters, and the device has 1000 packages (if one installs more than that on a low-end device then there are much more things to worry about :). This is already a guess at the upper end of the range, and the proto only takes ~100KB in this case.\n\n\u003e Btw, just out of curiosity, do you know more exactly how it crashes when the same class is present in both class loaders?\n\nThe crash is:\n\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: method com.android.server.art.prereboot.PreRebootManager.run argument 5 has type com.android.server.art.model.BatchDexoptParams, got com.android.server.art.model. BatchDexoptParams\n\nAs a explained earlier, ART uses `\u003cclass-loader, class-name\u003e` to identify a class, so the same class in those two jars are considered two different classes. In this case, the old `com.android.server.art.model.BatchDexoptParams` is considered different from the new `com.android.server.art.model.BatchDexoptParams`. Hence we get this weird error message.\n\nAlternative to serializing the object to a proto, we can also construct an object of the new class in the old code using reflection. However, I\u0027m not a fan of this idea because it makes the API surface between the two jars obscure. In this case, `PreRebootManagerInterface` would import `BatchDexoptParams` and `BatchDexoptParams` imports others, so it\u0027s easy to lose track of what exactly are on the API surface. In contrast, in the protobuf approach, it\u0027s clear that there are only `PreRebootManagerInterface` and the proto that are on the API surface.",
