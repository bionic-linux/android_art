How about\n\n// If the original new-array instruction is no longer present\n// in the code (as indicated by an negative index), we make a\n// best effort to find any other new-array instruction to \n// apply the mutation to. If that effort fails, we simply\n// bail by doing nothing.",

      "message": "oh this is not what I meant. It is/was not really a loop *in* a loop, but a loop *after* loop (both here and in your original). \n\nWhat I meant is that you scan the instructions in the method to find a new-array. Then, when found, you call indexOf, which again scans the instructions, this time to find the index.\n\nWhy not keep the index while scanning, so in L148, with a bit of different logic (see elsewhere in dexfuzz)",
