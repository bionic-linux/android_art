      "message": "Not related to the CL, but I am not sure I understand this comment. Is the first part just saying it is OK to read the obsolete methods and obsolete dex caches anytime since the writes suspend all threads? \n\n\u003e\u003e We do synchronize when setting it however, since that can happen at any time.\n\nI am a bit confused about this. Is that saying we should set the fields with proper synchronization? Is that related to ExtendObsoleteArrays that happens next?",
