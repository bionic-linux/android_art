      "message": "So I noticed a few things:\n\nIt\u0027s called BitVector, but it\u0027s really a BitArray because there is no push-back, insert, etc. There is no distinct length/capacity like in a real vector.\n\nIf it seems to be \"unnecessary work\", perhaps the allocator should have a wrapper to enforce zero-initialization (with memset(0)) or at least a trait to indicate if it does that?\n\n---\n\n\nAny sane data structure should have a well-defined initial state, in this case, as a post-condition of BitVector{} the bits accessible via iterator should be all 0s.",
