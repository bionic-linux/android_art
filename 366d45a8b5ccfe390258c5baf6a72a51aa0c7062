(`art_standalone_test_defaults` and `libnativeloader-test-defaults` set `host_supported: false`.)\n\nIt sounds like the tests you\u0027re referencing are for the host instead? We don\u0027t seem to have the same issues with the host testing, but maybe it\u0027s good to use version scripts there too for consistency.\n\nEven with this CL, we still have an instance of `-Wl,--exclude-libs\u003dlibartd-gtest.a` in `art_gtest_defaults`, which is hiding some symbols via a different mechanism.",

We run hwasan on device, but I see some successful runs on PS1 so apparently nothing is needed there.\n\n@ishcheikin@google.com, you added this in https://r.android.com/2623410, and `art_standalone_*` were device-only then too. Did you notice any problems for those tests, and if so in which test configs?\n\nOtherwise it\u0027s fine to ignore host - if we extend these defaults to apply there we\u0027ll figure something out then.",
