      "message": "I had prototyped the same for x86/x86_64 since it does help to clean up e.g. the code generated by dynamic BCE quite a bit (and thus avoids the need to add a simplifier to that part of the code).\n\nIf we go this route, and I am supportive, I would propose to make one last GVN at the end of the general optimization, and remove all arch specific GVNs. That way, we unify the six archs a bit, exposing them all to the same paths again.",
