I added expectations under EXEC_FAILED error category but tests were still failing with\n\n\u003e Test using the getrandom() syscall, only available from Linux 3.17.\n\u003e http://b/141230711\n\u003e test.java.awt Failed task: run test.java.awt ERROR\n\u003e [45/144] Test set test.java.awt FAILED (0 test(s) failed)\n\nNotice that the result of the task is ERROR, and I suspect putting expectations under EXEC_FAILED makes the test \"fail\" in terms of vogar while ERROR is expected.",
