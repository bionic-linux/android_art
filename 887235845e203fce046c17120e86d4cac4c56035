      "message": "android_root is used throughout the compiler, elf writer... Previously we were unconditionally setting it in the case of boot.art and I think that was a mistake as the GetAndroidRoot code is in effect being executed to set up android_root, except that logic also allows for the command line override. I don\u0027t follow the previous usage message and making this specific to the case of the boot image also doesn\u0027t seem right. For context, this change is necessary for the \"oat-target\" build dependency to work.",
