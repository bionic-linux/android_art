      "message": "Patchset #3 has a variant that tries to keep all hot methods contiguous (sticking them in the middle), but a few different benchmark runs didn\u0027t show any improvement. See https://dashboards.corp.google.com/_0e1b06dd_a79e_4433_b625_b62e5cac004b?p\u003dBootImageProfileId:42023 (patchset #2 is the latest version). I tried a few runs and this version was neutral to an improvement across almost every metric, and that\u0027s without the madvise follow-up tweak.",
