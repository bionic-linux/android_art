      "message": "Very nice change!\n\nI wonder if it would be possible to protect against raw usage of TMP/TMP2/FTMP (e.g. if someone doesn\u0027t know about ScratchRegisterScope). Something like, if an instruction uses TMP/TMP2/FTMP, then the assembler checks that these bits are zero in the scratch register mask (registers are booked). But this is not a guarantee that they were booked by the same function, and probably too much hassle to check on every instruction anyway.",
