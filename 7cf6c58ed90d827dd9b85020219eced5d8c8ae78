      "message": "Late comment, following an offline discussion with Nicolas: it seems that invoking the `run-test` script no longer triggers building the test(s) prior to running them, which means one has to manually build them beforehand. This seems like a regression to me. Could we consider reintroducing this behavior in the script?",

      "message": "Fair enough.  It is a change of behavior.  Although I would argue the old status quo was odd.  That is, changing java file would get picked out, but changing cpp file would not get picked up.  Personally, my work-flow was always based on \"test.py -b\" as I never really want to run the tests without the code changes that I just made.\n\nMy proposal would be \n1) reduce the number of scripts that we use to run tests\n2) build all dependencies by default to reduce the suprises",
