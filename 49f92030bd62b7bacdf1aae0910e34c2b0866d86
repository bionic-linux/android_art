      "message": "Your issue is likely with the prebuilt Ubuntu being referred to above in this file - Ubuntu 22.04 is on the 6.2 kernel, while vector support was only added in 6.5. We would need to pull in an image with that support for this to have a chance of working, but how that practically happens I think is a question for the ART team (I assume we\u0027re not thrilled with the idea of pulling an unstable release).",

Mantic Minotaur will be available in a few weeks according to this schedule.\nhttps://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/mantic-minotaur-release-schedule/34989\n\nI could just carry a local revert of soong/cc/config/riscv64_device.go until then. \n\nHowever, I don\u0027t know who/where else uses buildbot-vm.sh - ngeoffray or vmarko, any thoughts?",
