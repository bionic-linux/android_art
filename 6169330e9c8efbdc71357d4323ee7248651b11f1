      "message": "There\u0027s a somewhat fragile implicit contract here that some methods (those above) are supposed to be called exactly once at the start of the job, while others loads an existing state file and are only to be called later on.\n\nCan we add some checks to ensure that contract is adhered to? I\u0027m thinking something like starting with a `delete` call, so we know the file doesn\u0027t exist and `load` will fail if neither of the methods above have been called. And then also have a check in those methods that no file exists already to catch the complementing case.\n\nThat\u0027s better off in a separate CL though.",
