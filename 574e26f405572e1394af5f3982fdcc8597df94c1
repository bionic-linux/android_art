      "message": "OK, so here\u0027s what I think would make the workaround easier to understand:\n\n1) Say you do ensureJitCompiled in the loop because GC might collect the JIT code.\n\n2) Remove the loop lines 180-185. This was only to make the methods jitted right? You shouldn\u0027t need that anymore.\n\n3) Remove the j variable. We should always eventually succeed, and the test harness already has a timeout.\n\n4) Maybe remove the whole loop from 179-192? You already looping back line 199, so I don\u0027t think trying your best to pass at the first try is worth it. Again, we will eventually succeed, right?\n\nSo the outcome of this cleanup is a simpler test, potentially slower for now, but we know once the workaround is not needed will just have to have its loop removed.",
