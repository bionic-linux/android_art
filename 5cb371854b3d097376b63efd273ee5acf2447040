      "message": "My comment was probably due to my concern that, although our HIR has a reasonably clean building API, changing and manipulating HIR later has become a bit cumbersome, trying to preserve all sorts of implicit invariant.\n\nThis change is no worse than others :-) but I was just hoping we could make this into a more general utility others could start to use too. If you don\u0027t see other use of it, it\u0027s fine.",
