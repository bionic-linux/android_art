Has it changed the error on riscv64 build?\n\nAlso, if it helps and we want to go ahead with this CL, TARGET_BUILD_UNBUNDLED should ideally be conditioned on the architecture (only for riscv64), not the ART_TEST_ON_VM variable. It\u0027s ok to have it as is for now.",

      "message": "Yep, I did try to run it on LUCI but it didn\u0027t pull the changes in from the art repository even when I patched the revision into the led command. It looks to me that the recipe might only build the master branch and not take into account the buildbucket commit inputs:\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build/+/refs/heads/main/recipes/recipes/art.py#64\n\nIf so, I\u0027ll need to make a patch to the recipe to build based on the buildbucket input refs and then I can properly test my changes.",
