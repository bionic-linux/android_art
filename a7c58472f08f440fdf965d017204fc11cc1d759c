      "message": "Sorry for not being clear enough. I think size_t comparisons should stay as \u003c and \u003d\u003d. The problem is that pointer \u003c and \u003e comparisons are only valid if both pointers point to within the same C++ object. Std::less, on the other hand, imposes a total order on pointers of a given type that is consistent with \u003c. They are commonly implemented the same way, but they officially do have significantly different semantics. I think pointer \u003d\u003d is also fine, so I don\u0027t know of a reason to use std::equal_to except as a parameter.",
