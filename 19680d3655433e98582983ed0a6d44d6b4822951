I actually tried\n\nCHECK-START-ARM64: ....\nCHECK-START-MIPS64: .....\n.... shared checker statements ....\n\nbut that does not work as I had hoped (it matches for MIPS64 in that case but not ARM64, and the other way around).\n\n*Others*? Is there any shorter way to express this for several, but not all, architectures?",
