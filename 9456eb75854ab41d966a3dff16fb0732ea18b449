      "message": "Thanks!\n\nYes, we build directly on the bot.  I quite sub-optimal, I know.  We have incremental builds, but even with that it is slow.  I am thinking that if we could enable RBE, it would be much better.  Or I know we can build on separate bot and copy the data over, but the is quite a steep learning curve.  I wouldn\u0027t know where to start.\n\nI see, the \"builder\" here is just arbitrary user defined string?  I have trying to find the other end (is that configs/chromium-swarm/bots.cfg ?)  In that case yes, we need only very few dimensions.  I can try to rename those.\n\nWe also have the issue that all of the names are obsolete.  (e.g. Nexus 6P is Nexus from 2015; we have not been using that for ages).  We would like to rename all of those, but I not quite sure what are all the paces that need to change, and I worry we might break the console in the meantime.  Nonetheless, I should probably try to do that as well.",
