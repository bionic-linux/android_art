      "message": "I intentionally chose a path outside of any (potential) APEX directory, because these are files that don\u0027t go into an APEX (although they may also get installed into one later, but that doesn\u0027t happen on host at least).\n\nThe examples you mention are unpacked APEXes, this is not. I think it\u0027s less confusing to make that clear with a path that doesn\u0027t look like an APEX name.\n\nBut maybe I didn\u0027t follow your reason for putting them into an APEX directory?",

      "message": "I should also add that I regard this as a quick fix only - what really should be done is to figure out why the images don\u0027t get installed into the proper APEX directory on host and fix that to work more like for device APEXes (this may be in scope of b/170935728). Then the test code can go back to looking for them in the APEX.",
