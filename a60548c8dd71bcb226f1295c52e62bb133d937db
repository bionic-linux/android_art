That\u0027s pretty clever but also shaky in the sense that it will stop testing what you want sooner or later.\n\nI\u0027d suggest making this a small regression Checker test (see test 532 for an example) where you make sure that the CFG contains the long-const to float conversion you expect after the register allocator has run).",
