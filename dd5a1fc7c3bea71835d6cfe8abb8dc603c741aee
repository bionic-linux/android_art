      "message": "According to Roland: The removal of the explicit test configuration for art_odrefresh_tests in aosp/1943286 means that the test configuration is now generated by Soong, which is adding art-host-test as test tag to this generated configuration (see https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:art/test/Android.bp;l\u003d215;drc\u003d3062075164e66db8001b5512dbf91b9b28ee4fc1), meaning it is being picked up by the art/art-host-gtest ATP configuration (http://google3/wireless/android/test_tools/atp/config/test/art/art-host-gtest.gcl;l\u003d26-29;rcl\u003d388294412).\n\nTherefore, we have to keep the explicit test configuration for art_odrefresh_tests for now, even though it\u0027s not used by the test runner. We hope we can get rid of the explicit test configuration eventually.\n\nRemoving the test configuration from art_standalone_odrefresh_tests should be fine, because we have the default config in the defaults (https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:art/test/Android.bp;l\u003d165;drc\u003d3062075164e66db8001b5512dbf91b9b28ee4fc1\n). I\u0027ll reland this change.",
