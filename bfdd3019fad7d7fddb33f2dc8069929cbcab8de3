      "message": "I have a vague uneasiness about the number of message queues we have lying around. Try grep -i MessageQueue -r system for some more C++ ones. But it may well be that we have nothing that\u0027s usable for what you want.\n\nThe implementation looks fine to me, so long as you care more about simplicity than minimizing contention, which sounds like it may be right here. For algorithms with less contention, see e.g. \"Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue Algorithms\" by Michael and Scott.",

      "message": "I agree, I was hoping we already had something like this around. Thanks for the suggestion to look for other queues in system. The options there were libfmq, and AidlMessageQueue, which seems to be built on libfmq. There were some other queues throughout the platform too, but these seemed mostly built into drivers and probably shouldn\u0027t be used here.\n\nLibfmq looks like it\u0027d work, but I\u0027d still need to build the SetTimeout functionality on top of it. Libfmq is a bounded queue, so there will be additional cases to handle like sending when the queue is full. \n\nThe version I have here makes use of ART\u0027s Mutex and ConditionVariable classes, which looks like they give us additional visibility into thread states, or more debugging options. Are those worth keeping?\n\nThanks for the paper suggestion as well. My main use case for this is to send sporadic messages to a low-priority background thread, so I don\u0027t expect contention will be an issue. I think simplicity is the more important aspect here.",

      "message": "I spent a few minutes trying to use libfmq as the backend. It looks like doing so requires taking a new dependency in ART, and libfmq doesn\u0027t seem to have all the build flavors we need. Because of that, I think it makes more since to stick with our own implementation instead.",

      "message": "ART pretty consistently uses its own Mutex and CV inside. Whether it ideally still should or not is an interesting question that we\u0027ve discussed a few times before. I think at this point it\u0027s not possible to switch everything to pthreads without providing additional functionality in bionic. (See e.g. ExclusiveLockUncontendedFor().) And currently the ART one probably performs a bit better? I don\u0027t think the bionic one spins before calling futex wait, though it almost certainly should. Posix\u0027 interface that doesn\u0027t distinguish mutex kinds by type also adds a bit of inherent overhead, and there are other historical issues with 32-bit bionic mutexes being a bit too small.\n\nSo I think they will both stay in the foreseeable future. I would use the ART one in ART code.",
