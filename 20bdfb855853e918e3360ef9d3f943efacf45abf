      "message": "Yeah, in hindsight perhaps we should try a bit harder to preserve Dex PCs for synthesized instructions.\n\nI think one of the problems mentioned by Aart was that a loop in the original Dex code, represented by a set of HIR instructions (corresponding to a given Dex PC range) could be turned into several loops of HIR instructions by vectorization optimizations (e.g. because of peeling).\n\nIs that really a problem to have several HIR instructions point to the same Dex PC? Is this supported by the debugger?",
