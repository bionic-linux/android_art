      "message": "There\u0027s also the aspect of avoiding special cases and duplicated logic. The symlink handling in Android.mk doesn\u0027t look specific to the APEX flavours, so why doesn\u0027t it work as-is?\n\nAlso, the make and Soong files don\u0027t generally seem restricted to actual products to me. If anyone wants to build a testing apex for some reason, I\u0027d think the build system should be able to do that. Then it\u0027s a matter of release packaging to decide what goes into shipped products, isn\u0027t it?",
