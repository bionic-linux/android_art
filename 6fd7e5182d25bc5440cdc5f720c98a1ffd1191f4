      "message": "I am unsure why we are seeing this here. When we invoke an obsolete method we should throw an error and not invoke the method. I am not sure what\u0027s happening here. It seems like we are executing some part of the new method (print \"Hello - Transformed\") and then throwing an exception. That seems a bit strange. I tried to look for documentation on invoking obsolete methods but I couldn\u0027t find any. In any case, executing a partial function seems incorrect. Is that a bug in jvm?",
