      "message": "This isn\u0027t clear to me. I agree for situations where a larger number of files are dexopted in a batch operation. However e.g. on package install only a few dex files get compiled, right?\n\nI reason like this: With a concurrency of 4 the first 4 dex2oat runs will be scheduled at the same time, and that\u0027s probably worse than running them one by one because of more I/O and memory bandwidth in parallel and higher memory footprint. The benefit comes later when dex2oat runs of different lengths have gotten the shutdown/startup periods out of sync between the CPUs. I\u0027d think that\u0027s getting likely to happen only after 8-10 runs.\n\nThat\u0027s of course just speculation, but it means the change isn\u0027t obviously beneficial. Do you have measurements?\n\nOtherwise I think this justifies extending it to boot reasons, but not package install.",
