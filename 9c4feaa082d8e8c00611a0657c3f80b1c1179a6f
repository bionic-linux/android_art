I think I did it since I didn\u0027t think it would make any difference since this will only be different if an exception is pending and we now update the dex-pc in that helper. I guess if some code relies on the dex_pc_ being set directly and not via pointer offset it could cause some problems.\n\nAnyway I\u0027ll make a fix.",
