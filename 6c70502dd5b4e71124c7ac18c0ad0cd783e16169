I thought you are talking about here: https://source.corp.google.com/android/system/linkerconfig/contents/namespace/systemdefault.cc;rcl\u003d7f98bff5cc3cc457cfc8dac5bcf3bc5299699071;l\u003d90\n\n\nI see this was first added here: https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/linkerconfig/+/1220460/9/contents/namespace/art.cc#40\n\nThe bug was originally b/129534335, which is marked as fixed :(",

We should still narrow it down more, and I\u0027ve opened b/171732668 to track that. I\u0027ve changed the TODO here to point to that one instead.",
