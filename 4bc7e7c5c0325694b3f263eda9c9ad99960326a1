      "message": "If the compiler filter is \"speed-profile\", the class is in the profile, and the method is not in the profile, do we use shared memory method? I think the behavior for \"verify\" should be consistent with that.\n\nIf it\u0027s fine to keep this condition here just to keep the behavior unchanged, but please leave a TODO and do a separate change to resolve this inconsistency.\n\nOr, can we avoid this condition since we now found that the boot time regression is not due to shared memory method?",
