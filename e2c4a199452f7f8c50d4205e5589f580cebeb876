For rationale see the Google style guide: http://go/cstyle#Integer_Types, subsection \"On Unsigned Integers\".\n\nI\u0027d prefer using signed ints if they aren\u0027t too small, but I wouldn\u0027t mix signed and unsigned in existing code. However since this external API is well isolated I thought it is ok here.",
