      "message": "Hi Hans, we indeed have a test failure. However this is due to the java verifier exception that seems to be happening when we skip \"PotentiallyMarkRuntimeThrow\" for more recent SDKs. I am also not quite sure how exactly the code triggers it though.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll manage to debug this in a reasonable time frame without the original CL author and reviewer. It may be that there\u0027s some issue with that class or the tool chain, or a class path issue. Or it may be that Nicolas\u0027 CL actually broke this. But I agree that submitting this CL, and debugging this later with Nicolas\u0027 or Vladimir\u0027s help is the best step forward here.\n\nPlease submit this at a time when a resulting postsubmit failure would be promptly noticed.",
