I think this is worth mentioning, as this is unusual (Checker tests were designed for AOT code originally).\n\nAlternatively, you could remove the `--jit` option here and disable all the non-JIT configurations of this test in test/knownfailures.json (but maybe this would betray the spirit of this testâ€¦).",
