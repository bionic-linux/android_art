      "message": "Its used to be that going from DexCache to DexFile was expensive, it isn\u0027t as much now. We had a mutable ArtMethod* in MethodHelper so that changing a method while walking a vtable say, wouldn\u0027t cause fresh DexFile lookups if the DexCache didn\u0027t change. When ArtMethods became move-able then these fields in MethodHelper became handles.",
