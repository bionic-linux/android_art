      "message": "@ngeoffray@google.com, Jiyong had concern on https://r.android.com/877973 back when the caller class was added, namely that this could resolve to a (vdex?) path in dalvik-cache. It was dismissed back then because the caller class would only be used for APEXes when there are no class loader.\n\nWith this that\u0027s no longer the case though, so is that correct? If so, do we have another way to find the source dex path, or do we need to decode dalvik-cache paths here?",

      "message": "Here\u0027s what Jiyong said:\n\n\u003e oh, I have the answer here. So it is a file path to the dex cache.\n\u003e \n\u003e IIUC, one thing that worries me is that the path contains arch as /data/dalvik-cache/arm64/aaaa@bbbb@cccc.dex... , which means this can\u0027t be used as an ID that uniquely represent the caller. Perhaps we can just send the basename?\n\nI mentioned vdex because that\u0027s the only file we write to dalvik-cache that can possibly contain dex code. It doesn\u0027t really matter - what matters is if this path can be to the dalvik-cache rather than the source apk or dex jar.",
