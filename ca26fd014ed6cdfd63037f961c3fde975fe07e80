      "message": "1) Is \"assume-verified\" only used for in-memory boot image compilation? If yes, maybe we should have a DCHECK to enforce that guarantee (do we already?). If no, then this comment should say something about other cases.\n\n2) Nit: I\u0027d reword second half of the comment to make it easier to read, e.g. \"This filter is used for in-memory compilation of boot image extension. In that scenario it is undesirable to use a lot of time to look up things now in hope it will be somewhat useful later.\"",

      "message": "1) It is currently the most important (only?) use case. But the filter predates this use case as it was historically used for some testing - I do not remember the details. Currently dex2oat does not know if was called to compile in memory (with mem_fd file descriptors). And dex2oat is responsible only for the compilation, not what the artifacts are used for, so it would be wrong to include such DCHECK() even if it was feasible.\n\n2) Done.",
