      "message": "This is okay but I\u0027d also rename the process itself, not just the thread, so this does not contribute to crash metric of processes like system_server and the like.\n\nConcretely this requires a call to  AndroidRuntime::getRuntime()-\u003esetArgv0.\nThe process name can be as long as you want.\n\nNote: I believe that if you pass setProcName\u003dtrue in setArgv0 you can skip the current call. Because the forked process will have only 1 thread \u003d\u003d the main thread, so the pthread_setname_np will have the same effect of what you are doing here",
