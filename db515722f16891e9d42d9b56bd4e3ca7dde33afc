      "message": "This CL is problematic since it removes the build time check that libdexfile.so doesn\u0027t end up in the system image, which would be bad (it should always be used from the ART APEX).\n\nFrom this I take it you don\u0027t actually need libdexfile in your case. The problem is that libunwindstack statically [declares a dependency](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:system/unwinding/libunwindstack/Android.bp;l\u003d156;drc\u003d41d01777d9cb0bbcc9d51e8b4aa3bb8719439b44) on libdexfile, while in reality it\u0027s optional. Is it possible to remove the `runtime_libs` dependency from the ramdisk variant of libunwindstack? +cferris as libunwindstack owner.",

      "message": "The problem is that soong does not support removing it for a single target type. However, it looks like I can move the runtime_libs value into a specific target for android. I think that\u0027s enough to make this work.\n\nIs there any specific tests I can use to make sure this works as expected?",
