      "message": "After the parsing we look through the given classpaths and remove any of the files matching the compilation source (passed with --dex-file).\n\nThis is the behaviour that has always been there and it looks sensible to me. The plot thickens for no prebuilds where you need -classpath argument and then import that to dex2oat arguments.\n\nI think we can do a clean up on how we do the things (I already have a TODO in dex2oat) but I think it will be a more consistent change and this is a easier. In theory, it could also happen for secondary dex files where we have no control over what class loaders get created.",
