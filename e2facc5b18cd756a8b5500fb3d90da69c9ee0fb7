      "message": "https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/158971/ had changed it such that the CC collector now uses a thread-local flag to control whether system weaks are allowed to be accessed during the system sweep.\n\nSo, this should be changed to something like:\n\n  while (UNLIKELY((!kUseReadBarrier \u0026\u0026 !allow_new_weaks_) ||\n                  (kUseReadBarrier \u0026\u0026 !self-\u003eGetWeakRefAccessEnabled()))) {\n    new_weaks_condition_.WaitHoldingLocks(self);\n  }\n\nlike the other system weak cases like montior_list.\n\nBy default, I\u0027ll go and make this change if no one does it sooner. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a major issue now as the issue is limited to the cases with lambda and the CC collector enabled.",
