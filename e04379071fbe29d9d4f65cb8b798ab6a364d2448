It is mentioned in the commit message (\"Clear the \"newly allocated\" status of regions only when setting them as (evac) from-space and non-evac from-space.\").\n\nI did not add a comment here as this change is a correction of the initial Sticky-Bit CC CL. I prefer to keep things separated, but I am planning to (eventually) submit everything from topic art-sticky-bit-cc (https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/q/topic:art-sticky-bit-cc+(status:open+OR+status:merged)) in one go.",
