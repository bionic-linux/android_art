      "message": "Will, Looking at the blame list for errata, looks like kryo cores were added here:\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a9e821b89daa55cc940c546b124101939d3f0451\n\nand the erratum itself was handled here:\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a5325089bd05a7b0259cc4038479d36308edbda2\n\nDo we need those patches as well or are the following patches (especially the 50de013d22e4 arm64: compat: Add CNTVCT trap handler) sufficient. My understanding is that they are sufficient since we now have a trap hanlder but wanted to check with you to be sure. Thanks!",

      "message": "For the errata workarounds, you\u0027ll need the logic to detect the errata and enable the trapping mechanism. However, I bet this won\u0027t be the last time hardware gets this wrong, so trying to detect that based on the kernel version feels futile to me. It\u0027s probably better to assume that the vendor has backported workarounds for their CPUs where they are needed.",
