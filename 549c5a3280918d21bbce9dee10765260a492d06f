However, it\u0027s prone to problems if we extend the passes further.\n\nCan\u0027t you add another @hide field to `OperationProgress` for the current pass instead?\n\nI think that should be fine as long as it\u0027s not part of the API, but if we can\u0027t do that due to API guidelines, we may be better off with a separate internal progress callback that\u0027s not conflated with the exposed one (except we could have an internal wrapper for this external `progressCallback` that implements the internal API).",

      "message": "Why then is there one callback per pass, instead of just having the pass in `OperationProgress` or as an argument to the callback? It seems clunky to me to encode a data parameter in the entry point, and the for loops over `BATCH_DEXOPT_PASSES` building lambdas below are examples of it - the callback code is the same for all passes and the pass is just used as data in it, so there seems to be no benefit.",
