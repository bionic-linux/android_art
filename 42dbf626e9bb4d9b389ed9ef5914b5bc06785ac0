Is \"it\" the status byte or the page contents?\n\nThe memory_order specifies whether accesses to other memory locations are made visible to threads that see the result of the write here or vice-versa. Accesses to a single memory location are always totally ordered. It seems that the atomicity here is only needed to ensure that a single thread does the mapping. Memory_order_relaxed suffices for that. The system call guarantees that the memory copied into the page is visible to the threads that faulted the page.",
