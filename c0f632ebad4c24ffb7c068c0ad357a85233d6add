      "message": "We\u0027ll want to play with this number.  As part of my rework of branch profiling, I\u0027ve changed the hotness counter to be a signed 16-bit int, so threshold would be capped at 32767.  I could go to 32 bits, but that would involve increasing the shadow frame size by 4 bytes.",

      "message": "On second thought, I can deal with this as-is.  To speed up branch profiling, I\u0027m caching a countdown value - and that\u0027s what\u0027s limited to signed 16-bits.  The actual threshold can be as large as you want - I\u0027ll just do updates in no-larger-than 16-bit batches.",
