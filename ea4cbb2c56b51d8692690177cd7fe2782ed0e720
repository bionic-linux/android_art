      "message": "See the bug for profiles before and after the CL.\n\nI have considered making the two `Find()` functions also ALWAYS_INLINE (in addition to FLATTEN) but the profiles I collected did not show much difference. Same for some other functions I considered for these attributes, such as `Insert()`.\n\nNote: While experimenting, I also noticed that FLATTEN shall inline even functions marked as NO_INLINE. This interfered with the things I wanted to try.",
