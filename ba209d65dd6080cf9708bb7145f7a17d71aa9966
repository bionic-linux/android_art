This would make it so that the optimizations can be done one-by-one, and we don\u0027t have to go through all of SHL\u0027s uses when there are no ADD insructions that use it.\n\nIf we move forward with this, the `      if (left \u003d\u003d right) {` check that you did is needed and maybe we can do it in `VisitAdd`",
