      "message": "Was what happened that the gc duration got longer with the heap verification turned on, which caused remaining_bytes to get larger and concurrent_start_bytes_ to get smaller, which caused more frequent GC invocations?\n\nAssuming that, in the normal case (ie. with the heap verification turned off), if there\u0027s an app that either allocates fast (higher allocation rate) or causes long GC durations (due to a large heap size, etc.), then could this change increase the chance that the concurrent GC starts too late (ie. can\u0027t keep up with the mutator) in theory?",
