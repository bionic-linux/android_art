For something like dex2oat it can make sense to use the uid of the app that\u0027s being compiled rather than dex2oat\u0027s uid.\n\nIn this case, since we\u0027re just doing System Server and the boot classpath, the uid of the app probably isn\u0027t particularly relevant, so using odrefresh\u0027s uid should be fine.\n\nAnyway, I bring this up just in case you think a different uid might be valuable.",
