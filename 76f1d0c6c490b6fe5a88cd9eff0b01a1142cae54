      "message": "\u003e Isn\u0027t it possible to detect them by path prefix alone?\n\nNo. First, there are two types of shared libraries: apk and jar. The former is like a normal package, located in `/system/app`, etc. if it\u0027s preinstalled, or `/data/app/...` if it\u0027s updated. The latter can be at any location, specified by xml files at `/system/etc/permissions`.\n\n\u003e If that\u0027s not a good idea, then how common is it that a package loads another package\u0027s shared library dependency? Iow, isn\u0027t it enough to do this check only for the loading package?\n\nIf a package loads another package\u0027s primary dex file, then the owning package\u0027s shared libraries are also loaded because they are in the primary dex file\u0027s class loader.",

      "message": "Ok, but when it\u0027s not a shared library this will recheck the same shared libraries used by many apps over and over again, which is a bit of a pity.\n\nIf it wasn\u0027t for the other case I\u0027ve added a comment on below, I\u0027d argue it\u0027s better to just ignore the shared libs and instead rely on the cache to speed up the non-recording of the popular ones.\n\nAs it is I can\u0027t think of a way to improve this appreciably (can\u0027t find any hint that PackageManager even maintains a data structure of all shared libs).",
