I thought they\u0027re (always?) in partition-global locations like \u003cpartition\u003e/framework and not really owned by any package. So:\n\n1. Isn\u0027t it possible to detect them by path prefix alone?\n\n2. If that\u0027s not a good idea, then how common is it that a package loads another package\u0027s shared library dependency? Iow, isn\u0027t it enough to do this check only for the loading package?",
