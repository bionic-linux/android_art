      "message": "\u003e Isn\u0027t it possible to detect them by path prefix alone?\n\nNo. First, there are two types of shared libraries: apk and jar. The former is like a normal package, located in `/system/app`, etc. if it\u0027s preinstalled, or `/data/app/...` if it\u0027s updated. The latter can be at any location, specified by xml files at `/system/etc/permissions`.\n\n\u003e If that\u0027s not a good idea, then how common is it that a package loads another package\u0027s shared library dependency?

For jar libraries, we wouldn\u0027t get any result after going through all packages because they don\u0027t belong to any packages. Do you mean we cache the results being \"not found\" for dex files on read-only partitions? This adds even more complexity on top of the complexity that we already have, and it\u0027s bad for peace of mind because it\u0027s unclear to me whether results for dex files on read-only partitions can even change or not.\n\nTaking a step back, this added check won\u0027t bring much cost. Most of the shared libraries have only one dex file and has no dependencies, so checking one is as trivial as a single string comparison on the dex path (that\u0027s why I didn\u0027t even add a HashSet for checked libraries, as a key lookup by the library name, which involves hashCode() and equals() may be even more expensive than the string comparison). In practice, the cost isn\u0027t measurable. The test app has two files (file (3) and (4) in http://b/328673771#comment4) that belong to other packages. When there is no LRU cache, finding the owning package for them needs iteration over all packages, which involves this added check, and as you can see, this check doesn\u0027t introduce a noticeable regression ((1) + (2) + (3) compared to (1) + (2) in http://b/328673771#comment5).",

Would that leave a (significant) gap for shared libs in other places?\n\nThe recursive function can multiply with a potentially large number of packages, so its performance can be highly variable and is hard to predict. I remain unconvinced of the real-world behaviour from your limited experiments - OEMs may have shared libs with larger dependency trees, and it may change over time as well.\n\nAs for complexity, my suggestions seems simpler code-wise since the recursive function disappears.

Well, there\u0027s the exception of remounting, and that\u0027s somewhat unfortunate but it\u0027s afterall a dev-only corner case.\n\nEven so, if we want to play safe there as well it\u0027s possible to deal with by stat\u0027ing the dex path both before entering it into the cache, and when the cached entry is used. Maybe with that approach it\u0027s not even necessary to check read-only partition prefixes?",
