      "message": "\u003e Isn\u0027t it possible to detect them by path prefix alone?\n\nNo. First, there are two types of shared libraries: apk and jar. The former is like a normal package, located in `/system/app`, etc. if it\u0027s preinstalled, or `/data/app/...` if it\u0027s updated. The latter can be at any location, specified by xml files at `/system/etc/permissions`.\n\n\u003e If that\u0027s not a good idea, then how common is it that a package loads another package\u0027s shared library dependency? Iow, isn\u0027t it enough to do this check only for the loading package?\n\nIf a package loads another package\u0027s primary dex file, then the owning package\u0027s shared libraries are also loaded because they are in the primary dex file\u0027s class loader.",
